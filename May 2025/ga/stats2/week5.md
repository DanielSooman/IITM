A company produces three types of widgets: Type A, Type B and Type C. The production cost of a widget depends on two independent random variables: machine 1 point efficiency (( M )) and raw material (( Q )). The machine efficiency ( M \sim \text{Uniform}{1, 2, 3} ), where ( M = 1 ) represents low efficiency, ( M = 2 ) represents moderate efficiency, and ( M = 3 ) represents high efficiency.
