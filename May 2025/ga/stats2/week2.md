1) A software engineer is testing a program for bugs. Each run of the program has a 15% chance of encountering a bug. Let \(X\) be a geometric random variable representing the number of runs until the first bug is found. Given that the program has already been run 3 times without finding any bugs, what is the probability that the first bug will be found after the 5th run? Enter the answer correct to two decimal places.
