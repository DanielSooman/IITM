1) **Common data for the below two questions:**  

Number of people \((X)\) who make a reservation in a restaurant on a particular day is a random variable with mean equal to 10 and variance equal to 5.  
Using Markov's inequality, find an upper bound on the probability that on a particular day, the number of reservations will exceed 30.

- ☐ \( P(X > 30) \geq \frac{10}{31} \)  
- ☐ \( P(X > 30) \leq \frac{10}{30} \)  
- ☐ \( P(X > 30) \leq \frac{10}{31} \)  
- ☐ \( P(X > 30) > \frac{5}{31} \)

    <th>Y \ X</th>
    <th>-1</th>
    <th>0</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1</td>
    <td>k</td>
    <td>1/6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1/6</td>
    <td>1/3</td>

5) **Common data for the below two questions:**

Riya and Kabir are playing a game where each of them rolls a fair six-sided die. Let \(X_1\) represent the outcome of Riya’s roll and \(X_2\) represent the outcome of Kabir’s roll. The final prize score is determined by the maximum of the two outcomes and is denoted by the random variable Z = max\((X_1, X_2)\).

Find the variance of the prize score Z. Enter the answer correct to two decimal places.

---


6) Calculate the covariance between Riya’s score \(X_1\) and the prize score Z. Enter the answer correct to two decimal places.

7) An urn contains 5 white balls and 5 red balls. 2 balls are selected at random. Let \(X\) denote the number of red balls drawn and let \(Y\) denote the number of white balls drawn. Find the correlation coefficient between \(X\) and \(Y\).

---


8) Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two independent discrete random variables. Define random variables \(U\) and \(V\) as

\[
U = \frac{X - E(X)}{SD(X)}, \quad V = \frac{Y - E(Y)}{SD(Y)}
\]

Find \(\text{Cov}(U, V)\).

9) Five students each from class 8, 9 and 10 have been nominated for the formation of the school committee. The number of boys and girls who are selected from each of the classes is given in Table 3.1.G.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Class 8</td>
    <td>Class 9</td>
    <td>Class 10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Girls</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Boys</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Table 3.1.G: Total number of boys and girls selected.

If the committee comprises of two students from each class, find the expected number of boys in the committee. (Enter the answer correct to 1 decimal point)

---


10) Let the two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) be independent with means equal to 15 and 9, and variances equal to 4 and 5, respectively. Find the value of \(\mathrm{Var}(XY)\).
Hint: If \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, \(X^2\) and \(Y^2\) are also independent.
