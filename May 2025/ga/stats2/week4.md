A petrol station receives a supply of petrol once each day. The daily petrol sales (in thousands of liters) are represented by the random variable (X), which has the 1 point following probability density function:
[
f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
k(1 - x)^4, & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
]

What should be the minimum supply to the station (in thousands of liters) so that the probability of the petrol running out on any given day is only 1%?
○ 0.4321 (thousand liters)
○ 0.3981 (thousand liters)
○ 0.6019 (thousand liters)
○ 0.9903 (thousand liters)

1, & x \geq 3
\end{cases}
]

What is the value of (P(1 < X < 2))? Enter the answer correct to three decimal places.

Let ( X ) be a continuous random variable with PDF
[
f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
kx^2, & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
]
Find the median of ( X ). Enter the answer correct to four decimal places.
Hint: The median ( m ) is the value such that ( P(X \leq m) = P(X > m) = 0.5 )

A meteorologist is studying rainfall patterns in a region. The CDF of the daily rainfall (X) in millimetres (mm) is modeled as ( F(x) = 1 - e^{-0.5x} ) for ( x \geq 0 ). What is the probability that on a randomly chosen day, the rainfall exceeds 10 mm? Enter the answer correct to four decimal places.
