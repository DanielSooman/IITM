### Comprehension Type Question:

The scores of a student in mathematics, physics and chemistry in her class-12 board exams are \(m, p\) and \(c\) respectively, where each score is out of 100. She has applied for three engineering streams in a college. Each stream assigns different weights to these three subjects to calculate her final score, which is again out of 100.

For example, the weight given to mathematics, physics and chemistry could be 0.2, 0.7 and 0.1 respectively by a stream. These weights are then multiplied with the corresponding scores to get the final score. Concretely, if the student has scored 85, 78, 40 in the three subjects, her final score for this stream is:

\[
0.2 \times 85 + 0.7 \times 78 + 0.1 \times 40 = 75.6
\]

This is called a weighted average. Note that the weights always sum to 1. Now, the weights assigned by the three streams for mathematics, physics and chemistry, in this order, are given below:

**Stream-1:** 0.2, 0.7, 0.1

**Stream-2:** 0.5, 0.3, 0.2

**Stream-3:** 0.1, 0.4, 0.5

The final score of the student in stream-1 is 81. It is 83 in stream-2 and 76 in stream-3. We wish to find the student's marks in the three subjects.


8) This is framed as a system of linear equations. Select all true options concerning the coefficient matrix if the vector of unknowns is given as

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
m \\
p \\
c
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Assume that the first equation corresponds to stream-1, second to stream-2 and last to stream-3.

☐ The first row is \(0.2, 0.7, 0.1\)

☐ The last row is \(0.1, 0.4, 0.5\)

☐ The first column is \(0.2, 0.7, 0.1\)

☐ The middle column is \(0.5, 0.3, 0.2\)
