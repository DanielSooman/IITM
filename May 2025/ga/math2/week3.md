**Comprehension Type Question:**

In genetics, a classic example of dominance is the inheritance of shape of seeds in peas. Peas may be round (associated with genotype R) or wrinkled (associated with genotype r). In this case, three combinations of genotypes are possible: RR, rr, and Rr. The RR individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas. In Rr individuals the R genotype masks the presence of the r genotype, so these individuals also have round peas.

Consider the crossing of RR with RR. This always gives the genotype RR, therefore the probabilities of an offspring to be RR, Rr, and rr respectively are equal to 1, 0, and 0. Next, consider the crossing of Rr with RR. The offspring will have equal chances to be of genotype RR and genotype Rr, therefore the probabilities of RR, Rr, and rr repectively are 1/2, 1/2, and 0. Finally, consider the crossing of rr with RR. This always results in genotype Rr. Therefore, the probabilities of genotypes RR, Rr, and rr are 0, 1, and 0, respectively.

The following table summarizes these facts :

  <tr>
    <th>Parents' genotypes</th>

9) Consider the set of real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\) along with the operations \(\oplus\) and \(\cdot\) defined as follows.

Addition: For all \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\), \(x \oplus y = xy\)  
Scalar multiplication: For all \(c, x \in \mathbb{R}\), \(c \cdot x = cx\).

In other words, addition and scalar multiplication are both defined by the usual multiplication of real numbers. From the options below, choose the set of statements that fail to hold for \((\mathbb{R}, \oplus, \cdot)\) as defined above.

☐ Existence of additive identity: There exists \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(x \oplus x_0 = x\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\).

☐ Existence of additive inverse: For every \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), there exists \(x' \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(x \oplus x' \) is equal to the additive identity.  
(Note that this fails to hold if the additive identity does not exist.)

☐ \(1 \cdot x = x\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\).

☐ \(c_1 \cdot (c_2 \cdot x) = (c_1 c_2) \cdot x\) for all \(c_1, c_2, x \in \mathbb{R}\).

☐ \(c \cdot (v_1 \oplus v_2) = c \cdot v_1 \oplus c \cdot v_2\) for all \(c, v_1, v_2 \in \mathbb{R}\).
