### Comprehension Type Question:

The network in Figure: M2W2GA1 shows a proposed plan for flow of traffic around a park. All the streets are assumed to be one-way and the arrows denote the direction of flow of traffic. The plan calls for a computerized traffic light at the South Street. Let \(2x_1, 3x_2, 2x_3,\) and \(x_4\) denote the average number (per hour) of vehicles expected to pass through the connecting streets (e.g., \(2x_1\) denote the average number (per hour) of vehicles expected to pass through the street connecting the North Street and West Street as shown in Figure: M2W2GA1). 400, 1000, 900, and \(c\) denote the average number (per hour) of vehicles expected to pass through West, North, East, and South Streets respectively.
