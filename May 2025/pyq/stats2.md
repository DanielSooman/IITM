The correct moment generating function (MGF) for the random variable $S = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$ is the third option:
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(\frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}\right)^3$$
---
## How to Find the MGF

### Step 1: Understand the Moment Generating Function
The moment generating function, or MGF, of a random variable **X** is defined as $M_X(\lambda) = E[e^{\lambda X}]$. It's a useful tool in probability theory because it uniquely determines the probability distribution of a random variable and can simplify calculations involving sums of independent random variables.

### Step 2: Find the MGF of a Single Uniform Random Variable
The random variable **X** is uniformly distributed on the set $\{-0.2, 0.2\}$. This means that X can take on two values, $-0.2$ and $0.2$, each with a probability of $1/2$.
So, the MGF of a single random variable **X** is:
$$M_X(\lambda) = E[e^{\lambda X}] = \sum_{x \in \{-0.2, 0.2\}} e^{\lambda x} P(X=x)$$
$$M_X(\lambda) = e^{\lambda(-0.2)} \cdot P(X=-0.2) + e^{\lambda(0.2)} \cdot P(X=0.2)$$
Since the probabilities are equal, $P(X=-0.2) = P(X=0.2) = 1/2$.
$$M_X(\lambda) = e^{-0.2\lambda} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + e^{0.2\lambda} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}$$

### Step 3: Find the MGF for the Sum of Independent and Identically Distributed Random Variables
The problem states that $X_1, X_2,$ and $X_3$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This is a crucial piece of information because it simplifies finding the MGF of their sum. For i.i.d. random variables, the MGF of their sum is the product of their individual MGFs.
$$M_S(\lambda) = M_{X_1+X_2+X_3}(\lambda) = M_{X_1}(\lambda) \cdot M_{X_2}(\lambda) \cdot M_{X_3}(\lambda)$$
Since they are identically distributed, their MGFs are all the same: $M_{X_1}(\lambda) = M_{X_2}(\lambda) = M_{X_3}(\lambda) = M_X(\lambda)$.
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(M_X(\lambda)\right)^3$$
Substituting the expression for $M_X(\lambda)$ we found in the previous step:
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(\frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}\right)^3$$
This matches the third option provided in the problem.

The level of significance is given by the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true. For the given problem, this is the probability that $T < c$ under the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 4$.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution

Under the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 4$, the sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{100}\sum_{i=1}^{100} X_i$ is normally distributed with a mean of $\mu_0 = 4$ and a variance of $\sigma^2/n = 36/100 = 0.36$. So, $\bar{X} \sim \text{Normal}(4, 0.36)$.

The test statistic is defined as $T = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_{100}}{100} = \bar{X}$. The test rejects $H_0$ if $T < c$. The level of significance, denoted by $\alpha$, is the probability of this event occurring when $H_0$ is true.

$\alpha = P(T < c | H_0 \text{ is true}) = P(\bar{X} < c | \mu = 4)$.

To find this probability, we standardize the random variable $\bar{X}$ to a standard normal variable $Z$. The formula for standardization is $Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_{\bar{X}}}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}}$, where $\mu_{\bar{X}} = 4$ and $\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \sqrt{0.36} = 0.6$.

$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - 4}{0.6}$.

Now, we can express the probability in terms of $Z$:

$\alpha = P\left(\frac{\bar{X} - 4}{0.6} < \frac{c - 4}{0.6}\right) = P\left(Z < \frac{c - 4}{0.6}\right)$.

Let $F_Z(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal variable $Z$. Then, $P(Z < z) = F_Z(z)$.

Therefore, $\alpha = F_Z\left(\frac{c - 4}{0.6}\right)$.

To match the options provided, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

$\frac{c - 4}{0.6} = \frac{c - 4}{6/10} = \frac{10(c - 4)}{6} = \frac{5(c - 4)}{3} = \frac{5c - 20}{3}$.

So, the level of significance is $\alpha = F_Z\left(\frac{5c - 20}{3}\right)$.

This corresponds to the **fourth option** in the provided image.

Based on the scenario, the correct test statistic is the sample mean and the appropriate hypothesis test is the **t-test**.

---

### **Explanation**

The image describes a situation where we're observing samples from a **normal distribution** and the **population variance is unknown**. We want to check if the mean is greater than a certain value, $\mu$. This is a classic hypothesis testing problem.

* **Test Statistic**: The test statistic is a value calculated from sample data during a hypothesis test. Its purpose is to help us decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. Since the question is about the population mean, the appropriate test statistic to use is the **sample mean**, denoted by $\bar{x}$ or, as shown in the options, $T = \text{Sample mean}$.
* **Hypothesis Test**: The choice of hypothesis test depends on what information we have.
    * A **z-test** is used when the population variance is known.
    * A **$\chi^2$-test** is typically used for testing hypotheses about the population variance.
    * A **t-test** is used when the population variance is unknown, which is exactly the case described in the problem. The t-test uses the sample standard deviation as an estimate for the population standard deviation, making it suitable for this scenario.

Therefore, the combination of the sample mean as the test statistic and the t-test as the hypothesis test is the correct choice.

The method of moments is a technique used to estimate population parameters. The core idea is to equate the theoretical moments of a distribution to the corresponding sample moments.

---

### Understanding the Exponential Distribution

The **exponential distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process. The probability density function (PDF) is given by:
$f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x \ge 0$.

The **mean** of an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$ is $\frac{1}{\lambda}$. This is also the first theoretical moment.

---

### Calculating the Sample Mean

The first sample moment is simply the sample mean. We are given a sample of 6 delivery times in hours: 15, 20, 15, 16, 14, 20.

The **sample mean** ($\bar{x}$) is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values:
$\bar{x} = \frac{15 + 20 + 15 + 16 + 14 + 20}{6} = \frac{100}{6} \approx 16.67$

---

### Applying the Method of Moments

To find the method of moment estimate of $\lambda$, we equate the first theoretical moment to the first sample moment:
**Theoretical Mean** = **Sample Mean**
$\frac{1}{\lambda} = \bar{x}$

Now, we can solve for the estimated value of $\lambda$, which we'll denote as $\hat{\lambda}$:
$\hat{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\bar{x}}$
$\hat{\lambda} = \frac{1}{16.67} \approx 0.06$

Rounding to two decimal places, the estimate for $\lambda$ is **0.06**.



<img width="1008" height="453" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a2020e5-04a1-402c-9a1a-9972623941aa" />


To find the value of $k$ for which $\hat{\mu}_2$ is an **unbiased estimator** of $\mu$, we need to ensure that the expected value of $\hat{\mu}_2$ is equal to $\mu$.

Given the formula for $\hat{\mu}_2$:
$$\hat{\mu}_2 = \frac{\hat{\mu}_1 - k}{(k-1)}$$
And the expected value of $\hat{\mu}_1$:
$$E(\hat{\mu}_1) = 2\mu + 3$$

The condition for $\hat{\mu}_2$ to be unbiased is $E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \mu$. Let's calculate the expected value of $\hat{\mu}_2$:
$$E(\hat{\mu}_2) = E\left(\frac{\hat{\mu}_1 - k}{k-1}\right)$$
Using the properties of expectation, we can separate the terms:
$$E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \frac{1}{k-1} E(\hat{\mu}_1 - k)$$
$$E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \frac{1}{k-1} [E(\hat{\mu}_1) - E(k)]$$
Since $k$ is a constant, its expected value is just $k$:
$$E(k) = k$$
Now, substitute the given expression for $E(\hat{\mu}_1)$:
$$E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \frac{1}{k-1} [(2\mu + 3) - k]$$
For $\hat{\mu}_2$ to be an unbiased estimator of $\mu$, we must have $E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \mu$. So, we set the equation equal to $\mu$:
$$\mu = \frac{2\mu + 3 - k}{k-1}$$
Now, we solve for $k$:
$$\mu(k-1) = 2\mu + 3 - k$$
$$\mu k - \mu = 2\mu + 3 - k$$
Rearrange the terms to group all terms with $\mu$ on one side and terms with $k$ and constants on the other side:
$$\mu k - 2\mu - \mu = 3 - k$$
This is incorrect. Let's start over from:
$$\mu k - \mu = 2\mu + 3 - k$$
We want to isolate $k$. Let's move all terms with $k$ to one side and terms with $\mu$ to the other:
$$\mu k + k = 2\mu + 3 + \mu$$
Factor out $k$ from the left side and combine terms on the right side:
$$k(\mu + 1) = 3\mu + 3$$
$$k(\mu + 1) = 3(\mu + 1)$$
Assuming $\mu + 1 \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $(\mu+1)$:
$$k = 3$$
The value of $k$ that makes $\hat{\mu}_2$ an unbiased estimator of $\mu$ is **3**. This matches the provided "Accepted Answer."

## Finding the Method of Moments Estimate of $p$

The method of moments estimate for a parameter is found by setting the sample moments equal to the population moments. For this problem, we'll use the first moment, the mean.

### Step 1: Calculate the population mean ($E[X]$)

The population mean for a discrete random variable is the sum of each value multiplied by its probability:
$E[X] = \sum x \cdot P(X=x)$
$E[X] = (0 \cdot \frac{p}{4}) + (1 \cdot \frac{p}{4}) + (2 \cdot \frac{p}{4}) + (3 \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4}))$
$E[X] = 0 + \frac{p}{4} + \frac{2p}{4} + 3 - \frac{9p}{4}$
$E[X] = 3 + \frac{3p-9p}{4} = 3 - \frac{6p}{4} = 3 - \frac{3p}{2}$

### Step 2: Calculate the sample mean ($\bar{x}$)

The sample is given as $(0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0)$. There are 9 data points.
$\bar{x} = \frac{0+3+2+2+3+1+2+3+0}{9} = \frac{16}{9} \approx 1.777...$

### Step 3: Set the population mean equal to the sample mean and solve for $p$

$E[X] = \bar{x}$
$3 - \frac{3p}{2} = \frac{16}{9}$
$3 - \frac{16}{9} = \frac{3p}{2}$
$\frac{27-16}{9} = \frac{3p}{2}$
$\frac{11}{9} = \frac{3p}{2}$
$11 \cdot 2 = 3p \cdot 9$
$22 = 27p$
$p = \frac{22}{27} \approx 0.8148...$

Rounding to one decimal place, the method of moments estimate for $p$ is **0.8**.

---

## Finding the Maximum Likelihood Estimate of $p$

The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is the value of the parameter that maximizes the likelihood function.

### Step 1: Write the Likelihood Function ($L(p|x)$)

The likelihood function is the product of the probabilities of observing each data point in the sample. The sample is given as $(0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3)$. Let $n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3$ be the number of times each value appears in the sample.
$n_0 = 2$ (for the value 0)
$n_1 = 1$ (for the value 1)
$n_2 = 2$ (for the value 2)
$n_3 = 4$ (for the value 3)

The total sample size is $n = n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 2+1+2+4 = 9$.

$L(p|x) = [P(X=0)]^{n_0} \cdot [P(X=1)]^{n_1} \cdot [P(X=2)]^{n_2} \cdot [P(X=3)]^{n_3}$
$L(p|x) = (\frac{p}{4})^2 \cdot (\frac{p}{4})^1 \cdot (\frac{p}{4})^2 \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4})^4$
$L(p|x) = (\frac{p}{4})^{2+1+2} \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4})^4 = (\frac{p}{4})^5 \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4})^4$

### Step 2: Find the Log-Likelihood Function ($\ln L(p|x)$)

It's easier to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function.
$\ln L(p|x) = \ln[(\frac{p}{4})^5 \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4})^4]$
$\ln L(p|x) = 5 \ln(\frac{p}{4}) + 4 \ln(1 - \frac{3p}{4})$
$\ln L(p|x) = 5(\ln p - \ln 4) + 4 \ln(1 - \frac{3p}{4})$

### Step 3: Differentiate with respect to $p$ and set the derivative equal to zero

$\frac{d}{dp} \ln L(p|x) = \frac{d}{dp} [5(\ln p - \ln 4) + 4 \ln(1 - \frac{3p}{4})]$
$\frac{d}{dp} \ln L(p|x) = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{p} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{3p}{4})} \cdot (-\frac{3}{4})$
$\frac{d}{dp} \ln L(p|x) = \frac{5}{p} - \frac{3}{(1 - \frac{3p}{4})}$

Setting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:
$\frac{5}{p} - \frac{3}{(1 - \frac{3p}{4})} = 0$
$\frac{5}{p} = \frac{3}{(1 - \frac{3p}{4})}$
$5(1 - \frac{3p}{4}) = 3p$
$5 - \frac{15p}{4} = 3p$
$5 = 3p + \frac{15p}{4}$
$5 = \frac{12p+15p}{4}$
$5 = \frac{27p}{4}$
$20 = 27p$
$p = \frac{20}{27} \approx 0.7407...$

Rounding to two decimal places, the maximum likelihood estimate for $p$ is **0.74**.

Based on the provided images, the problem asks to find the posterior distribution and the posterior mean of the parameter $\theta$ for a discrete random variable $X$.

## Posterior Distribution of $\theta$

The problem specifies a discrete random variable $X$ with values $\{1, 3, 5\}$ and corresponding probabilities $\{\frac{\theta}{2}, 1-\theta, \frac{\theta}{2}\}$. The parameter $\theta$ is in the range $[0, 1]$. We are given a sample of observations: $\{1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 5\}$.

First, let's count the frequency of each value in the sample:
- Number of times $X=1$: 4
- Number of times $X=3$: 3
- Number of times $X=5$: 3
The total sample size is 10.

The **likelihood function** for the sample is the product of the probabilities of each observation:
$L(\theta | \text{data}) = P(X=1)^4 \cdot P(X=3)^3 \cdot P(X=5)^3$
$L(\theta | \text{data}) = (\frac{\theta}{2})^4 \cdot (1-\theta)^3 \cdot (\frac{\theta}{2})^3$
$L(\theta | \text{data}) = (\frac{\theta}{2})^7 \cdot (1-\theta)^3 = \frac{1}{2^7} \theta^7 (1-\theta)^3$

The **prior distribution** of $\theta$ is given as a Beta distribution, Beta($\alpha_0, \beta_0$) with $\alpha_0 = 5$ and $\beta_0 = 6$. The probability density function (PDF) of the prior is:
$f(\theta) \propto \theta^{\alpha_0 - 1} (1-\theta)^{\beta_0 - 1} = \theta^{5-1} (1-\theta)^{6-1} = \theta^4 (1-\theta)^5$

According to **Bayes' theorem**, the posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:
$f(\theta | \text{data}) \propto L(\theta | \text{data}) \cdot f(\theta)$
$f(\theta | \text{data}) \propto (\frac{1}{2^7} \theta^7 (1-\theta)^3) \cdot (\theta^4 (1-\theta)^5)$
$f(\theta | \text{data}) \propto \theta^{7+4} (1-\theta)^{3+5} = \theta^{11} (1-\theta)^8$

This posterior PDF has the form of a **Beta distribution** with parameters $\alpha_1 = 11+1 = 12$ and $\beta_1 = 8+1 = 9$.
Therefore, the posterior distribution of $\theta$ is **Beta(12, 9)**. This corresponds to the third option in the provided image.

---

## Posterior Mean of $\theta$

The mean of a **Beta distribution**, Beta($\alpha, \beta$), is given by the formula:
$E(\theta) = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$

For the posterior distribution Beta(12, 9), the posterior mean is:
Posterior Mean $= \frac{12}{12 + 9} = \frac{12}{21}$

To express this as a decimal rounded to two places:
Posterior Mean $= \frac{12}{21} \approx 0.5714...$

Rounding to two decimal places, we get **0.57**. This value falls within the accepted range of 0.54 to 0.60 shown in the image.

Based on the provided images, here is a step-by-step analysis of the hypothesis test.

---

### **Formulating Hypotheses**

First, we need to formulate the **null hypothesis** ($H_0$) and the **alternative hypothesis** ($H_A$).
* The university's claim is that the average time ($\mu$) is 60 minutes. This forms our null hypothesis: $H_0: \mu = 60$.
* The analyst believes the average time is **less than** 60 minutes. This forms our alternative hypothesis: $H_A: \mu < 60$.

Therefore, the correct hypothesis choice is $H_0: \mu = 60, H_A: \mu < 60$.

---

### **Calculating the Test Statistic**

Next, we calculate the **Z-score** to determine how many standard deviations the sample mean is from the population mean. We'll use the formula:
$$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$

Given the values from the problem:
* Sample mean ($\bar{x}$) = 59.3 minutes
* Population mean ($\mu$) = 60 minutes
* Population standard deviation ($\sigma$) = 5 minutes
* Sample size ($n$) = 100

Plugging these values into the formula:
$$Z = \frac{59.3 - 60}{5 / \sqrt{100}}$$$$Z = \frac{-0.7}{5 / 10}$$$$Z = \frac{-0.7}{0.5}$$
$$Z = -1.4$$

Our calculated Z-statistic is **-1.4**.

---

### **Determining the Conclusion**

Now, we compare the calculated Z-statistic to the critical values for the specified significance levels. Since this is a **left-tailed test** ($H_A: \mu < 60$), the critical region is in the left tail of the standard normal distribution. 
* **Significance level $\alpha = 0.05$**: The critical value for a one-tailed test is **-1.645**. Our calculated Z-score of **-1.4** is **greater than** -1.645. Since the test statistic does not fall into the rejection region (i.e., it's not less than -1.645), we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. Thus, we **accept** $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$.

* **Significance level $\alpha = 0.01$**: The critical value for a one-tailed test is **-2.33**. Our calculated Z-score of **-1.4** is **greater than** -2.33. Since the test statistic does not fall into the rejection region (i.e., it's not less than -2.33), we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. Thus, we **accept** $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.01$.

Since we fail to reject the null hypothesis at both significance levels, the correct conclusions are:
* **Accept $H_0$ at significance level $\alpha = 0.05$**
* **Accept $H_0$ at significance level $\alpha = 0.01$**
