The correct moment generating function (MGF) for the random variable $S = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$ is the third option:
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(\frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}\right)^3$$

## How to Find the MGF

### Step 1: Understand the Moment Generating Function
The moment generating function, or MGF, of a random variable **X** is defined as $M_X(\lambda) = E[e^{\lambda X}]$. It's a useful tool in probability theory because it uniquely determines the probability distribution of a random variable and can simplify calculations involving sums of independent random variables.

### Step 2: Find the MGF of a Single Uniform Random Variable
The random variable **X** is uniformly distributed on the set $\{-0.2, 0.2\}$. This means that X can take on two values, $-0.2$ and $0.2$, each with a probability of $1/2$.
So, the MGF of a single random variable **X** is:
$$M_X(\lambda) = E[e^{\lambda X}] = \sum_{x \in \{-0.2, 0.2\}} e^{\lambda x} P(X=x)$$
$$M_X(\lambda) = e^{\lambda(-0.2)} \cdot P(X=-0.2) + e^{\lambda(0.2)} \cdot P(X=0.2)$$
Since the probabilities are equal, $P(X=-0.2) = P(X=0.2) = 1/2$.
$$M_X(\lambda) = e^{-0.2\lambda} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + e^{0.2\lambda} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}$$

### Step 3: Find the MGF for the Sum of Independent and Identically Distributed Random Variables
The problem states that $X_1, X_2,$ and $X_3$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This is a crucial piece of information because it simplifies finding the MGF of their sum. For i.i.d. random variables, the MGF of their sum is the product of their individual MGFs.
$$M_S(\lambda) = M_{X_1+X_2+X_3}(\lambda) = M_{X_1}(\lambda) \cdot M_{X_2}(\lambda) \cdot M_{X_3}(\lambda)$$
Since they are identically distributed, their MGFs are all the same: $M_{X_1}(\lambda) = M_{X_2}(\lambda) = M_{X_3}(\lambda) = M_X(\lambda)$.
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(M_X(\lambda)\right)^3$$
Substituting the expression for $M_X(\lambda)$ we found in the previous step:
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(\frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}\right)^3$$
This matches the third option provided in the problem.
