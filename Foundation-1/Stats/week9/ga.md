A discrete random variable \( X \) can take the values \( 1, 2, \dots, 8 \). For these values, the cumulative distribution function is defined by: 
\[ F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \frac{x^2 + k}{99}, \, x = 1, 2, \dots, 8. \]  
Find the value of \( k \).

An organization in Texas organizes a lucky draw this month. 5 thousand tickets are sold for 2\$ each. Each has an equal chance of winning. 1 ticket will win 1077\$, 3 tickets will win 507\$, and 11 tickets will win 109\$. Let the random variable \( X \) denote the net gain from the purchase of one ticket. What is the probability that \( X \) takes the value less than 507\$? (Enter the answer correct to 4 decimal places)
