5) 
The length of time for one person to be served at a restaurant is exponentially distributed with an expected time of 2 minutes. If **5** persons arrived at the restaurant, then what is the probability that at least 2 of them will be served in more than 8 minutes? (Assume that each person is served independently) 

- ⭘ \( 1 - (e^{-4.0})^5 - \left[ 5 \left( e^{-4.0} \right)^4 \left( 1 - e^{-4.0} \right) \right] \)
- x \( 1 - (1 - e^{-4.0})^5 - \left[ 5 e^{-4.0} \left( 1 - e^{-4.0} \right)^4 \right] \)
