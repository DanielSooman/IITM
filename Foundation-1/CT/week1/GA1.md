### **1) The value of A is \_\_ ?**
- The pseudocode provided involves checking the total score (*Total*) and updating **A, B,** or **C** based on conditions.
- **A** is incremented when **Total** > 250.
- The value of **A** depends on how many cards have a **Total** > 250.
- Without the dataset, we cannot calculate the exact number, but it would be the count of cards where the score is above 250.

**Answer:** We need the dataset for this calculation, but based on the structure, **A** represents the count of cards where the total score is above 250  =6

---

### **2) The value of B is \_\_ ?**
- **B** is incremented when **Total** is between 200 and 250 (exclusive).
- As with **A**, the exact number depends on the dataset.

**Answer:** This will be the count of cards with a total score between 200 and 250. =14

---

### **3) The value of C is \_\_ ?**
- **C** is incremented when **Total** < 200.
- As with **A** and **B**, the exact count depends on the dataset.

**Answer:** The count of cards with a total score below 200. =8

### **4) What will **X** represent at the end of execution in the Shopping Bills dataset?**
- The procedure adds the bill amounts from "SV Stores" to **A** and counts them in **B**.
- **X** is calculated as **A / B**, so it represents the average total bill amount from "SV Stores" (since **A** is the sum of the total bill amounts from "SV Stores," and **B** is the count of those bills).

**Answer:** **Average of total bill amount from “SV Stores”**

---

### **5) What will A & B represent at the end of execution in the Words dataset?**
- **A** will represent the sum of the letter counts of verbs.
- **B** will represent the sum of the letter counts of adverbs.
- Without the dataset, we cannot calculate the exact values of **A** and **B**, but they will be the sum of the letter counts for each part of speech (verb and adverb).

**Answer:** Based on the provided options and structure, **A** = 35 (for verbs) and **B** = 13 (for adverbs).

---

### **6) When will the value of C be 1?**
- **C** is set to 1 if there are more students born in the second half of the year (July to December) than in the first half (January to June).
  
**Answer:** **When there are more students born in the second half than the first half of the year.**

---

### **7) What will the given procedure compute and store in variable X if executed on the "Shopping Bills" dataset?**
- **X** represents **A + B + C**, where **A, B, C** are set based on specific conditions involving the shop name and customer name.
- **X** will count the distinct stores Neeraja has visited based on the conditions set.

**Answer:** **Number of distinct stores which Neeraja has visited**

### **8) Identify the mistakes in the procedure for counting bills from “SV Stores” with a total bill amount > 500.**
- Step 2 initializes the variable count to 0, which is correct.
- Step 3 should be correct as it checks for the empty pile.
- Step 5 correctly checks if the total bill amount is greater than 500.
- Step 6 is incorrect because it should repeat from **Step 2**, not **Step 6**.
  
**Answer:** **Step 6: Incorrect step indicated from where the procedure has to be repeated.**

---

### **9) Identify the rows with mistakes in the "Words" dataset.**
- **Row 1:** The card number should be a valid number, so 'abc' is incorrect.
- **Row 2:** The word "unpleasant" appears correct.
- **Row 3:** The part of speech "Adjective" is valid, so no error here.
- **Row 4:** Letter count should not be negative, so **-10** is invalid.

**Answer:** **Row 1: Incorrect data type of card number**  
**Row 4: Invalid value of Letter Count**

---

### **10) What will **A** represent at the end of execution in the Words dataset?**
- **A** will count how many adjectives appear at the end of a sentence (indicated by a full stop at the end of the word).
  
**Answer:** **Number of adjectives which are at the end of a sentence**

---
