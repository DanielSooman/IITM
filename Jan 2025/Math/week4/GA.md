There are some questions which have functions with discrete valued domains (such as day, month, year etc). For simplicity, we treat them as continuous functions.

For NAT type question, enter only one right answer, even if you get multiple answers for that particular question.

**Notations:**

ℝ = Set of real numbers  
ℚ = Set of rational numbers  
ℤ = Set of integers  
ℕ = Set of natural numbers  

The set of natural numbers includes 0.

4) An ant named **B** wants to climb an uneven cliff and reach its anthill (i.e., home of ant). On its way home, **B** makes sure that it collects some food. A group of ants have reached the food locations which are at *x*-intercepts of the function  
**f(x) = (x² − 24) \((x − 10)³ − 1\)**.  
As ants secrete pheromones (a form of signals which other ants can detect and reach the food location), **B** gets to know the food location. Then the sum of the *x*-coordinates of all the food locations is  11
