8) Consider three Airports A, B, and C. Two friends Ananya and Madhuri want to meet at Airport C. Ananya boarded Flight 1 from Point A to C which is 1200 km, due to bad weather, Flight 1 slowed down, and the average speed was reduced by 200 km/h and the time increased by 30 minutes. Madhuri boarded Flight 2 from Point B to C which is 1800 km, the average speed of Flight 2 is 720 km/h. What is the waiting time, and who will be waiting at the airport? (Given Ananya and Madhuri boarded at the same time)

- [ ] Waiting Time is 1 hr and Ananya is waiting.

- [ ] Waiting Time is 1 hr and Madhuri is waiting.

- [ ] Waiting Time is 30 min and Ananya is waiting.

- [ ] Waiting Time is 30 min and Madhuri is waiting.

Use the following information for questions 1-3. A ballistic missile is launched from a fighter jet flying at a height of 40 m from the ground. The missile hits the tank which is present on the ground, as shown in Figure M1G3T5-2. The function \( h(t) = -8t^2 + 32t + 40 \) represents the height (in meters) of the missile after t seconds. Assume the dimensions of the tank and the fighter jet are negligible.


11) Find out the maximum height(in meters) attained by the missile.


12) Find out the time (in seconds) when the missile hits the tank.


13) Suppose an air defense system is present at the origin, and it follows the straight line path \( h(t) = 10t \), find the height from the ground at which the air defense missile will destroy the ballistic missile in the air.  

- [ ] 40 m
- [ ] 12.5 m
