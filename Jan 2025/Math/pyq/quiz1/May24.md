Radhika has been tracking her monthly expenses and the corresponding number of outings she has with friends. Here's a table with two rows representing the amount spent on entertainment and the corresponding number of outings. Let’s consider *y* to be the amount spent and *x* to be the corresponding number of outings. She fitted a best fit line to her data and obtained the equation *y = 4x + 15*. What is the value of SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) in relation to the best fit line?

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Amount spent</th>
    <td>37</td>
    <td>44</td>
    <td>53</td>
    <td>50</td>
