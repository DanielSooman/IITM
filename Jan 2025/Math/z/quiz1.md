Let the correct quadratic equation be of the form $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, since the leading coefficient is given to be 1.

Case 1: Ram made a mistake in writing down the constant term.
This means Ram kept the coefficient of x correct, which is 'b'.
Let the incorrect constant term be $c'$.
So, the equation Ram solved was $x^2 + bx + c' = 0$.
The roots obtained by Ram are 3 and 4.
For a quadratic equation $x^2 + Bx + C = 0$, the sum of roots is $-B$ and the product of roots is $C$.
For Ram's equation, the sum of roots is $3 + 4 = 7 = -b$.
Thus, $b = -7$.
The product of roots is $3 \times 4 = 12 = c'$. This $c'$ is the incorrect constant term.

Case 2: Shyam made a mistake in writing down the coefficient of x.
This means Shyam kept the constant term correct, which is 'c'.
Let the incorrect coefficient of x be $b'$.
So, the equation Shyam solved was $x^2 + b'x + c = 0$.
The roots obtained by Shyam are 2 and 3.
For Shyam's equation, the product of roots is $2 \times 3 = 6 = c$.
Thus, $c = 6$.
The sum of roots is $2 + 3 = 5 = -b'$. This $b'$ is the incorrect coefficient of x.

From Case 1, we found the correct coefficient of x, $b = -7$.
From Case 2, we found the correct constant term, $c = 6$.
Therefore, the correct quadratic equation is $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, which is $x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0$.

To find the roots of the correct equation $x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0$, we can factorize it or use the quadratic formula.
Factorizing: We look for two numbers that add up to -7 and multiply to 6. These numbers are -1 and -6.
So, $x^2 - 7x + 6 = (x - 1)(x - 6) = 0$.
The roots are $x - 1 = 0$ or $x - 6 = 0$.
The roots are $x = 1$ and $x = 6$.

Alternatively, using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$ for $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$.
Here $A = 1, B = -7, C = 6$.
$x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 24}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2} = \frac{7 \pm 5}{2}$.
The roots are $x_1 = \frac{7 + 5}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6$ and $x_2 = \frac{7 - 5}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$.

The correct roots of the quadratic equation are 1 and 6.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{1 and 6}$
