4) Half-life of an element is the time required for half of a given sample of radioactive element to change to another element. The rate of change of concentration is calculated by the formula \( A(t) = A_0 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{\gamma}} \) where \( \gamma \) is the half-life of the material, \( A_0 \) is the initial concentration of the radioactive element in the given sample, \( A(t) \) is the concentration of the radioactive element in the sample after time \( t \). If Radium has a half-life of 1100 years and the initial concentration of Radium in a sample was 100%, then calculate the percentage of Radium in that sample after 3300 years.

8) In a survey, the population growth in an area can be predicted according to the equation  
\[
a(T) = a_0 \left( 1 + \frac{d}{100} \right)^T
\]  
where \( d \) is the percentage growth rate of population per year and \( T \) is the time since the initial population count \( a_0 \) was taken. If in 2016, the population of Adyar was 42000.0 and the population growth rate is 6% per year, then what will be the approximate population of Adyar in 2021? (\( T = 0 \) corresponds to the year 2016, \( T = 1 \) corresponds to the year 2017 and so on..)
