2) Suppose three distinct persons A, B and C are standing on the X-axis of the XY-plane (as shown in the figure) and the distance between B and A is same as the distance between C and B. The coordinates of A, B and C are (log<sub>5</sub>3, 0), (log<sub>5</sub>(3<sup>x</sup> − 9/2), 0) and (log<sub>5</sub>(3<sup>x</sup> − 9/4), 0) respectively. What is the distance between C and B?

3) In a city, a rumour is spreading about the safety of corona vaccination. Suppose N number of people live in the city and f(t) is the number of people who have not yet heard about the rumour after t days. Suppose f(t) is given by f(t) = N e<sup>−kt</sup>, where k is a constant. If the population of the city is 1000, and suppose 40 have heard the rumor after the first day. After how many days (approximately) half of the population would have heard the rumor?  
**Note:** Enter the nearest integer value.

### Use the following information for the questions 4 and 5.  

Consider the function f(x) = 3x<sup>2</sup> / (3e<sup>x</sup> + 1) from ℝ to ℝ.  

---

4) Which of the following is true about f? 

- [ ] f is not a one to one function.  
- [ ] f is a one to one function.  
- [ ] Range of f is ℝ.  
- [ ] None of the above.

---

5) The inverse of \( f \) would be  
- [ ] \( \ln\left(\frac{2x}{2 - 3x}\right) \)  
- [ ] \( \ln\left(\frac{x}{2 - 3x}\right) \)  
- [ ] \( \ln\left(\frac{x}{2x - 3}\right) \)

**Use the following information for the questions 6 and 7.**  

The amount of gold (in kilograms) sold by a jeweler on the \( m \)-th day of 2019 is given by the function  
\[ f(m) = \log_{10}(m + 1) - \frac{1}{2} \log_{m+1}(0.01) \]  
(where \( m = 1 \) corresponds to the 1st January, 2019, and \( m = 365 \) corresponds to the 31st December, 2019).  

6) If \( m > n > 9 \), then choose the correct option(s).  
- [ ] \( f(m) > f(n) \)  
- [ ] \( f(m) < f(n) \)  
- [ ] \( f(m) = f(n) \)  
- [ ] \( f(m) \leq f(n) \)  

7) Choose the correct option(s).  
- [ ] The jeweler sold 540 kg gold in 2019.  
- [ ] The jeweler sold at least 730 kg gold in 2019.  
- [ ] The jeweler sold at least 2 kg gold daily throughout the year 2019.  
- [ ] The jeweler sold at least 10 kg gold daily throughout the year 2019.

8) The stock market chart of a tourism company (\( A \)) is shown roughly in the Figure below. This company was listed in February (\( x = 2 \)) and experiences a logarithmic fall after the COVID-19 outbreak which is given by  
\[ y = -a \log(x - h) + a. \]  
\( x \) represents the number of months since the beginning of the year and \( y \) represents the stock price in ₹(1000). During the 10th month the pharmacy company announced that the vaccine is made for the COVID-19. Thereafter, the stock price of the company (\( A \)) is raised exponentially  
\[ y = 10^b - b. \]  
Choose the correct set of options. (Note: \( a \) is any positive real number, \( b \) is a positive integer and \( h \) is a constant.)

- [ ] For logarithmic fall the value of \( a = 1.5 \) and \( h = 2 \).  
- [ ] For exponential rise passing through \( (10, 0) \) the value of \( b = 10 \).  
- [ ] The stock price in \( 12^{th} \) month is ₹4000.  
- [ ] If the vaccine was not made and the stock price just followed the same logarithmic function throughout, then the investor would have lost his/her entire investment on the \( 12^{th} \) month.
