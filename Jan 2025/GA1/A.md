### 1) **Identify the sample and population.**

- The correct answer is:  
  **The sample consists of four randomly selected IITs of India and the population consists of all the engineering institutes of India.**

Explanation:  
- **Population** refers to the entire group you're studying (in this case, all engineering institutes of India).
- **Sample** refers to the smaller group from which data is actually collected (here, the four IITs of India).

### 2) **The report given by an analyst to the education minister about the status of campus placements states that “The campus placement of B.Tech students is 95% in different engineering institutes of India”. The given statement of analyst is based on which kind of statistical analysis?**

- The correct answer is:  
  **Inferential Statistics**

Explanation:  
- **Inferential Statistics** is used when conclusions or inferences are made about a population based on a sample. Here, the analyst is making a generalized statement about all engineering institutes in India based on data from a sample (the four IITs).

---

### 3) **Is the conclusion of this study made by the analyst on the basis of the chosen sample reliable?**

- The correct answer is:  
  **No**

Explanation:  
- The conclusion is based on data from only four IITs, which may not be representative of all engineering institutes across India. For the result to be reliable, the sample should ideally represent the entire population of interest (all engineering institutes in India). Given that only IITs were considered, the conclusion may not be fully reliable for the entire population.

### 4) **Which of the following statements is/are true?**

- The correct options are:  
  - **[ ] Inorganic is a case and Types of Fertilizers is a variable.**
  - **[ ] Rice is a case.**
  - **[ ] Manure is a case.**
  - **[x] Amount of fertilizers is a variable.**
  - **[ ] Nitrogen is a variable.**

Explanation:  
- **Inorganic** and **Manure** are specific types of fertilizers, so they represent cases. 
- **Amount of fertilizers** is a quantitative value that varies and hence is a **variable**. 
- **Rice** is a crop type, which could be treated as a categorical case.
- **Nitrogen** is a specific type of fertilizer, not a variable in this context.

---

### 5) **What is the scale of measurement of “Types of Crops”?**

- The correct answer is:  
  **Nominal Scale**

Explanation:  
- **Nominal Scale** involves categories or labels without any order. "Types of Crops" (e.g., Rice, Wheat, Potato) are different categories of crops, making this a nominal variable.

---

### 6) **What kind of variable is “Area of fields”? (More than one option can be correct)**

- The correct options are:  
  - **[ ] Categorical**
  - **[x] Numerical**
  - **[ ] Discrete**
  - **[x] Continuous**

Explanation:  
- **Area of fields** is a numerical value and can be measured on a continuous scale because area can take any value within a range and is not restricted to distinct, separate values.

---

### 7) **What is the scale of measurement of “Amount of Fertilizers”?**

- The correct answer is:  
  **Ratio Scale**

Explanation:  
- The **Ratio Scale** has a meaningful zero point and allows for comparison of ratios (e.g., 400 kg of fertilizer is twice as much as 200 kg). "Amount of Fertilizers" is a ratio-scale variable because it involves quantities that can be measured and have a true zero.

---

### 8) **Is the data given in Table 1.1.G structured or unstructured?**

- The correct answer is:  
  **The data is structured**

Explanation:  
- The data in the table is organized in a clear, predefined format with rows and columns, making it **structured**. Structured data is typically well-organized and easy to analyze.

---

### 9) **The data of Netflix subscribers at the end of year 2020 across different Asian countries is recorded. Based on this, choose the correct option:**

- The correct answer is:  
  **It is cross-sectional data**

Explanation:  
- **Cross-sectional data** refers to data collected at a specific point in time across different subjects (e.g., Netflix subscribers across different countries at the end of 2020).

---

### 10) **Choose the incorrect statement(s):**

- The incorrect statements are:  
  - **Number of assignments submitted by a student has an interval scale of measurement.**

Explanation:  
- **Interval scale** involves variables that have equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature). The **number of assignments** is a **ratio scale** because it is a count with a true zero (zero assignments means none). The other statements are correct:
  - **Stock price** is a continuous variable and can be measured on a ratio scale.
  - **Soccer positions** are ranked (ordinal scale), but the ranking doesn't imply equal intervals.
  - **Education level** is categorical and nominal (no inherent order in categories).
