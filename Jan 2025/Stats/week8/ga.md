1) Zaheer Khan has taken 4 five-wicket hauls in his last 16 matches. His match records are selected at random, one by one, and analyzed. If none of the match records is analyzed more than once, then what is the probability that the 10th one analyzed is his last five-wicket haul match?

3) An item is produced in three factories **A**, **B**, and **C**. Factory **A** produces 5 times the number of items produced by factory **B**, and the factories **B** and **C** produce the same number of items. It is known that 8%, 7%, 4% of the items produced by factories **A**, **B**, and **C** respectively are defective. All items produced in the three factories are stocked, and an item is selected at random. What is the probability that the selected item is defective? (Enter the answer correct to two decimal places)

7th Question is the common data. Use the data in the question 7 to answer from Question number 8 to question number 10.  

7) Two researchers adopted different sampling techniques while investigating the same group of students to find the number of students falling in different intelligence levels. The results are given in Table Q8.1.G:  

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Researcher</th>
      <th>No. of students in each level</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Below Avg.</th>
      <th>Avg.</th>
      <th>Above Avg.</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>X</td>
      <td>74</td>
      <td>68</td>

      <td>Y</td>
      <td>48</td>
      <td>22</td>
      <td>28</td>
    </tr>

11) During the monsoon, it rains one-third of the days and affects students' travel to school. The probability that there will be heavy traffic on a rainy day is 0.5 and on a non-rainy day is 0.25. If it rains and there is heavy traffic, the probability of a student arriving late to school is 0.5. If it is a clear day and there is no traffic, this probability is reduced by \( \frac{3}{8} \). In other possible situations, the probability of a student reaching school late is 0.25. If on a randomly selected day, a student arrives late to school, then what is the probability that it rained that day?  

**Hint:** Consider the event as,  
\( H \) = There is heavy traffic  
\( H^c \) = There is no traffic.  

- [ ] \( \frac{1}{8} \)  
- [x] \( \frac{6}{11} \)  
- [ ] \( \frac{11}{48} \)  
- [ ] None of the above

12) There are two shops, \( A \) and \( B \), selling t-shirts in the market. Shop \( A \) has stock of \( n \) red and 2 black t-shirts and Shop \( B \) has a stock of 2 red and \( n \) black t-shirts. One of the shops is selected at random and two t-shirts are purchased from it. If both the t-shirts purchased are red and the probability that it was purchased from shop \( A \) is \( \frac{6}{7} \), find the value of \( n \).
