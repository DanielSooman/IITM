An unbiased die is thrown 22 times. After each throw a '+' is recorded for 2 or 5 and '-' is recorded for 1, 3, 4, or 6, the signs forming an ordered sequence. To each, except the first and last sign, a random variable \( X_i, i = 1, 2, ..., 20 \) is associated which takes the value 1 if both of its neighbouring signs differ from the one between them and 0 otherwise. If the random variable \( Y \) is defined as \( Y = 10S + 26 \) where, \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{20} X_i \), find the expected value of \( Y \).

Amandeep is in the middle of a bridge of infinite length. He takes the unit step to the right with probability 0.66 and to the left with probability 0.34. Assume that the movements are independent of each other.  

**Hint:** Consider the random variable \( X_i \) associated with the \( i^{th} \) step defined as:  
\[

1 & \text{if the step of Amandeep is towards the right} \\ 
-1 & \text{if the step of Amandeep is towards the left}

Rohit wants to open his door with 5 keys (out of which 1 will open the door) and tries the keys independently and at random. If unsuccessful keys are eliminated from further selection, then find the expected number of trials required to open the door.  
  **Hint:** Suppose Rohit gets the first success at \( x^{th} \) trial, i.e., he is unable to open the door in the first \( (x - 1) \) trials.  
  And, \( P(\text{he gets first success at second trial}) = (1 - \frac{1}{5}) \times \frac{1}{4} \).
