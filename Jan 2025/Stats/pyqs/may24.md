To solve for x, we need to understand what 'relative frequency' means in the context of this table.
Relative frequency is calculated as the ratio of the number of books read by a specific student to the total number of books read by all students.

We are given the following information from Table Q.1:
| Students   | Number of books | Relative frequency |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Sunil      | 15              | x                  |
| Prateek    |                 | y                  |
| Kanika     | 6               | 0.1                |
| Kunal      | 15              |                    |
| Sonakshi   |                 | z                  |

We know the number of books read by Kanika is 6, and her relative frequency is 0.1. We can use this information to find the total number of books read by all students.

The formula for relative frequency is:
Relative Frequency = (Number of books read by a student) / (Total number of books read by all students)

For Kanika, we have:
0.1 = 6 / (Total number of books)

To find the total number of books, we can rearrange the formula:
Total number of books = 6 / 0.1
Total number of books = 60

Now that we know the total number of books is 60, we can find the relative frequency for Sunil (x).
The number of books read by Sunil is 15.

Using the formula for relative frequency for Sunil:
x = (Number of books read by Sunil) / (Total number of books read by all students)
x = 15 / 60

Simplify the fraction:
x = 15 / 60 = 1 / 4 = 0.25

Therefore, the value of x is 0.25.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{0.25}$
