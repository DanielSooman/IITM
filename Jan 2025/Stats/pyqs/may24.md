To solve for x, we need to understand what 'relative frequency' means in the context of this table.
Relative frequency is calculated as the ratio of the number of books read by a specific student to the total number of books read by all students.

We are given the following information from Table Q.1:
| Students   | Number of books | Relative frequency |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Sunil      | 15              | x                  |
| Prateek    |                 | y                  |
| Kanika     | 6               | 0.1                |
| Kunal      | 15              |                    |
| Sonakshi   |                 | z                  |

We know the number of books read by Kanika is 6, and her relative frequency is 0.1. We can use this information to find the total number of books read by all students.

The formula for relative frequency is:
Relative Frequency = (Number of books read by a student) / (Total number of books read by all students)

For Kanika, we have:
0.1 = 6 / (Total number of books)

To find the total number of books, we can rearrange the formula:
Total number of books = 6 / 0.1
Total number of books = 60

Now that we know the total number of books is 60, we can find the relative frequency for Sunil (x).
The number of books read by Sunil is 15.

Using the formula for relative frequency for Sunil:
x = (Number of books read by Sunil) / (Total number of books read by all students)
x = 15 / 60


Simplify the fraction:
x = 15 / 60 = 1 / 4 = 0.25

Therefore, the value of x is 0.25.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{0.25}$

Create a two-way contingency table and find out the number of males in this group who own a
smartphone

Here's the step-by-step process to create the contingency table and find the number of males who own a smartphone:

**1. Understand the Categories:**

We need to classify students based on two categories:

*   **Gender:** Male and Female
*   **Smartphone Ownership:** Own a smartphone and Do not own a smartphone

**2. Extract Information from the Text:**

Let's list down the direct information provided:

*   Total number of students = 32
*   Number of females = 27
*   Number of males who do not own a smartphone = 3
*   Total number of students who do not own a smartphone = 26

**3. Calculate Derived Information:**

We can deduce some information from the provided data:

*   Number of males = Total students - Number of females = 32 - 27 = 5
*   Number of females who do not own a smartphone = Total students who do not own a smartphone - Number of males who do not own a smartphone = 26 - 3 = 23

**4. Construct the Contingency Table:**

We will set up a 2x2 table with "Gender" as rows and "Smartphone Ownership" as columns (or vice-versa). Let's use "Gender" as rows:

|             | Own Smartphone | Do not own Smartphone | Total |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------|
| **Male**    |                |                       |       |
| **Female**  |                |                       |       |
| **Total**   |                |                       |       |

**5. Fill in the Known Values:**

Now, let's populate the table with the information we have:

|             | Own Smartphone | Do not own Smartphone | Total |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------|
| **Male**    |                | 3                     | 5     |  *(Number of males who do not own a smartphone = 3, Total males = 5)*
| **Female**  |                | 23                    | 27    |  *(Number of females who do not own a smartphone = 23, Total females = 27)*
| **Total**   |                | 26                    | 32    |  *(Total students who do not own a smartphone = 26, Total students = 32)*

**6. Calculate the Missing Values:**

To complete the table, we need to find the missing values:

*   **Number of males who own a smartphone:**  Total males - Number of males who do not own a smartphone = 5 - 3 = 2
*   **Number of females who own a smartphone:** Total females - Number of females who do not own a smartphone = 27 - 23 = 4
*   **Total students who own a smartphone:** Total students - Total students who do not own a smartphone = 32 - 26 = 6  (Alternatively, sum of males and females who own smartphone: 2 + 4 = 6)

**7. Complete Contingency Table:**

|             | Own Smartphone | Do not own Smartphone | Total |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------|
| **Male**    | **2**          | **3**                 | **5**   |
| **Female**  | **4**          | **23**                | **27**  |
| **Total**   | **6**          | **26**                | **32**  |

**8. Answer the Question:**

The question asks for the number of males in this group who own a smartphone.  From the completed contingency table, we can see that the number of males who own a smartphone is **2**.

**Answer:**

Number of males in this group who own a smartphone is **2**.

**Contingency Table:**

|             | Own Smartphone | Do not own Smartphone | Total |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------|
| **Male**    | 2              | 3                     | 5     |
| **Female**  | 4              | 23                    | 27    |
| **Total**   | 6              | 26                    | 32    |
