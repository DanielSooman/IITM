 4) There are a total of 130 students who are part of badminton, table tennis and tennis team of the college. Of which 60% of students play table tennis, 10% play tennis and 70% play badminton. It is also noticed that all students who play tennis also play table tennis but not badminton. Now a student is selected at random, what is the probability that he/she is the part of table tennis team only? (Enter the answer correct to 1 decimal place)

11) An urn contains 3 balls numbered 1, 2, and 3. The co-efficient of equation \( px^2 + qx + c = 0 \) is determined by **1 point** drawing the numbered balls with replacement. What is the probability that the equation will have imaginary roots?

Nature of roots:
Consider a quadratic equation:  
\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]  

Compute \( D = b^2 - 4ac < 0 \)  

\[
\text{Roots} = 
\begin{cases} 
D < 0 & \text{imaginary roots} \\ 
D \geq 0 & \text{real roots} 
\end{cases}
\]
