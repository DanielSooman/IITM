This is a problem that uses the properties of **determinants** and **matrix algebra**. Here's how to solve for $\det(A)$.

## Solving for $\det(A)$

The given matrix equation is:
$$A + 4I = 0$$

Where:
* $A$ is a **$3 \times 3$ matrix**.
* $I$ is the **$3 \times 3$ identity matrix**.
* $0$ is the **$3 \times 3$ zero matrix**.

### Step 1: Isolate the Matrix $A$
First, isolate $A$ by subtracting $4I$ from both sides of the equation:
$$A = -4I$$

### Step 2: Apply the Determinant Property
Now, take the **determinant** of both sides:
$$\det(A) = \det(-4I)$$

We use the property of determinants for a scalar multiple of a matrix:
$$\det(kA) = k^n \det(A)$$
where $k$ is a scalar and $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix.

In our case, the scalar is $k = -4$, and the matrix is $I$, which is of order $n=3$.
$$\det(-4I) = (-4)^3 \det(I)$$

### Step 3: Calculate the Result
Substitute the known value for the determinant of the identity matrix, which is always 1:
$$\det(I) = 1$$

So, the equation becomes:
$$\det(A) = (-4)^3 \cdot 1$$
$$\det(A) = (-4) \times (-4) \times (-4)$$
$$\det(A) = 16 \times (-4)$$
$$\det(A) = -64$$

---

## Final Answer

The determinant of matrix $A$ is:
$$\det(A) = -64$$
