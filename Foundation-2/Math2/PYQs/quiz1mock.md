This is a problem that uses the properties of **determinants** and **matrix algebra**. Here's how to solve for $\det(A)$.

## Solving for $\det(A)$

The given matrix equation is:
$$A + 4I = 0$$

Where:
* $A$ is a **$3 \times 3$ matrix**.
* $I$ is the **$3 \times 3$ identity matrix**.
* $0$ is the **$3 \times 3$ zero matrix**.

### Step 1: Isolate the Matrix $A$
First, isolate $A$ by subtracting $4I$ from both sides of the equation:
$$A = -4I$$

### Step 2: Apply the Determinant Property
Now, take the **determinant** of both sides:
$$\det(A) = \det(-4I)$$

We use the property of determinants for a scalar multiple of a matrix:
$$\det(kA) = k^n \det(A)$$
where $k$ is a scalar and $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix.

In our case, the scalar is $k = -4$, and the matrix is $I$, which is of order $n=3$.
$$\det(-4I) = (-4)^3 \det(I)$$

### Step 3: Calculate the Result
Substitute the known value for the determinant of the identity matrix, which is always 1:
$$\det(I) = 1$$

So, the equation becomes:
$$\det(A) = (-4)^3 \cdot 1$$
$$\det(A) = (-4) \times (-4) \times (-4)$$
$$\det(A) = 16 \times (-4)$$
$$\det(A) = -64$$

---

## Final Answer

The determinant of matrix $A$ is:
$$\det(A) = -64$$

This is a linear algebra question about bases in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

The key piece of information is that the set $B = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3\}$ **forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$**.

Since $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3$ is a basis for a 3-dimensional space, any set of **three vectors** in $\mathbb{R}^3$ will also form a basis if and only if they are **linearly independent**.

A set of vectors $\{\mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \mathbf{u}_3\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$ if and only if any one of the following equivalent conditions is met:
1.  The vectors are **linearly independent**.
2.  The determinant of the matrix formed by their components is **non-zero**.
3.  The vectors **span** $\mathbb{R}^3$.

In this context, a simpler approach is to consider the **transition matrix** between the basis $B$ and the new set. A set $B' = \{\mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \mathbf{u}_3\}$ is a basis if and only if the matrix whose columns are the coordinates of $\mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2, \mathbf{u}_3$ with respect to the original basis $B$ is **invertible** (i.e., its determinant is non-zero).

Let $B = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3\}$.
The coordinates of $\mathbf{v}_i$ in $B$ are:
$$[\mathbf{v}_1]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_2]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_3]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

## Analysis of the Options

### Option 1: $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_3\}$

The coordinate vectors in basis $B$ are:
$$[\mathbf{v}_1]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_2]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_3]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

The transition matrix $M_1$ is:
$$M_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
This is an upper triangular matrix, so the determinant is the product of the diagonal entries:
$$\det(M_1) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \neq 0$$
Since the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent, and **this set forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$**.

---

### Option 2: $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_3\}$

The coordinate vectors in basis $B$ are:
$$[\mathbf{v}_1]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_3]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

The transition matrix $M_2$ is:
$$M_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
$$\det(M_2) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \neq 0$$
Since the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent, and **this set forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$**.

---

### Option 3: $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_3\}$

The coordinate vectors in basis $B$ are:
$$[\mathbf{v}_1]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_3]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$$

The transition matrix $M_3$ is:
$$M_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$
$$\det(M_3) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) = -1 \neq 0$$
Since the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent, and **this set forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$**.

---

### Option 4: $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_3\}$

The coordinate vectors in basis $B$ are:
$$[\mathbf{v}_1]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_2]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad [\mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_3]_B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$$

The transition matrix $M_4$ is:
$$M_4 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$
$$\det(M_4) = 1 \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1) = 1 \neq 0$$
Since the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent, and **this set forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$**.

---

## Conclusion

Since the question asks "which of the following are true" and all four options are true statements, you should select **all four options**. This is common in multiple-choice questions that allow for multiple correct answers.

**The true statements are:**

* $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_3\}$ forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
* $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_3\}$ forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
* $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_3\}$ forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
* $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 - \mathbf{v}_3\}$ forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

This is a linear algebra problem about **linear independence**. The key is to use the given information that the set $\mathbf{\{ (a, b), (c, d) \}}$ is a linearly independent subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

---

## 🔑 Key Information

The set $S_2 = \{ (a, b), (c, d) \}$ is **linearly independent** in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

* This means the only solution for the equation $k_1(a, b) + k_2(c, d) = (0, 0)$ is the trivial solution $k_1 = 0$ and $k_2 = 0$.
* Equivalently, the **determinant** of the matrix formed by these vectors, $\det \begin{pmatrix} a & c \\ b & d \end{pmatrix}$, is **non-zero**.
    $$\det \begin{pmatrix} a & c \\ b & d \end{pmatrix} = ad - bc \neq 0$$

---

## 🔎 Analyzing the Options

We are looking for a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that *must* be linearly independent. A set of vectors $\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_m \}$ is linearly independent if the only solution to the vector equation $k_1\mathbf{v}_1 + k_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + k_m\mathbf{v}_m = \mathbf{0}$ is $k_1 = k_2 = \dots = k_m = 0$.

Let the first two vectors in the $\mathbb{R}^3$ sets be $\mathbf{v}_1 = (a, b, 0)$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = (c, d, 0)$.

### Option 1: $\{ (a, b, 0), (c, d, 0) \}$

The vector equation for linear independence is $k_1(a, b, 0) + k_2(c, d, 0) = (0, 0, 0)$.
This simplifies to:
1.  $k_1a + k_2c = 0$
2.  $k_1b + k_2d = 0$
3.  $0 = 0$ (This equation is always true and provides no information).

Since $\mathbf{\{ (a, b), (c, d) \}}$ is linearly independent, the system formed by equations (1) and (2) has **only the trivial solution $k_1 = 0, k_2 = 0$**.
Therefore, $\{ (a, b, 0), (c, d, 0) \}$ **must be linearly independent**.

---

### Option 2: $\{ (a, b, 0), (c, d, 0), (0, 0, 1) \}$

The vector equation is $k_1(a, b, 0) + k_2(c, d, 0) + k_3(0, 0, 1) = (0, 0, 0)$.
This leads to the system of equations:
1.  $k_1a + k_2c + 0 = 0$
2.  $k_1b + k_2d + 0 = 0$
3.  $k_1(0) + k_2(0) + k_3(1) = 0 \implies k_3 = 0$

Substituting $k_3 = 0$ into the first two equations gives:
1.  $k_1a + k_2c = 0$
2.  $k_1b + k_2d = 0$

As established in Option 1, since $\mathbf{\{ (a, b), (c, d) \}}$ is linearly independent, this system only has the solution $\mathbf{k_1 = 0}$ and $\mathbf{k_2 = 0}$.
Since $k_1 = 0, k_2 = 0, k_3 = 0$ is the only solution, the set $\{ (a, b, 0), (c, d, 0), (0, 0, 1) \}$ **must be linearly independent**.

---

### Option 3 & 4: Sets with $(1, 0, 0)$ or $(0, 1, 0)$

* **Option 3:** $\{ (a, b, 0), (c, d, 0), (1, 0, 0) \}$
* **Option 4:** $\{ (a, b, 0), (c, d, 0), (0, 1, 0) \}$

Consider the linear combination $k_1(a, b, 0) + k_2(c, d, 0) + k_3\mathbf{v}_3 = (0, 0, 0)$, where $\mathbf{v}_3$ is $(1, 0, 0)$ or $(0, 1, 0)$.
Notice that $\mathbf{v}_1 = (a, b, 0)$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = (c, d, 0)$ both lie on the $xy$-plane (where $z=0$). The third vector, $\mathbf{v}_3$, also lies on the $xy$-plane since $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 1, 0)$ have a $z$-component of $0$.

Any set of three vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose span is a **two-dimensional plane** (like the $xy$-plane) **cannot be linearly independent**. A basis for the $xy$-plane is only two vectors, e.g., $\{(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)\}$. Since all three vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3$ are in the $xy$-plane, they are **linearly dependent** because the dimension of the space they span is 2, while the number of vectors is 3.

* In $\mathbb{R}^3$, any set of three vectors lying in the same plane is **linearly dependent**.
* Therefore, both Option 3 and Option 4 are **incorrect**.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the sets that *must* be linearly independent are:

1.  $\{ (a, b, 0), (c, d, 0) \}$
2.  $\{ (a, b, 0), (c, d, 0), (0, 0, 1) \}$

These are the two correct options.

Certainly! To find the value of $x$, you need to first calculate the determinants of matrices $A$ and $B$ and then set them equal to each other, as $\text{det}(A) = \text{det}(B)$. The problem states that $x$ is a natural number ($\mathbf{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$).

Here are the matrices:
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} -3 & 5 & -1 \\ 0 & -2 & 3 \\ 7 & -4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
$$B = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 0 & x \\ x & -5 & 2 \\ -2 & 7 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

---

## 1. Calculate $\text{det}(A)$

We'll use cofactor expansion along the first column, as it contains a zero, simplifying the calculation.
$$\text{det}(A) = (-3) \cdot \text{det}\begin{pmatrix} -2 & 3 \\ -4 & 1 \end{pmatrix} - (0) \cdot \text{det}\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -1 \\ -4 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + (7) \cdot \text{det}\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -1 \\ -2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$$

$$\text{det}(A) = (-3) \cdot [(-2)(1) - (3)(-4)] - 0 + (7) \cdot [(5)(3) - (-1)(-2)]$$

$$\text{det}(A) = (-3) \cdot [-2 - (-12)] + (7) \cdot [15 - 2]$$

$$\text{det}(A) = (-3) \cdot [-2 + 12] + (7) \cdot [13]$$

$$\text{det}(A) = (-3) \cdot (10) + 91$$

$$\text{det}(A) = -30 + 91$$

$$\mathbf{\text{det}(A) = 61}$$

---

## 2. Calculate $\text{det}(B)$

We'll use cofactor expansion along the first row.
$$\text{det}(B) = (-2) \cdot \text{det}\begin{pmatrix} -5 & 2 \\ 7 & 0 \end{pmatrix} - (0) \cdot \text{det}\begin{pmatrix} x & 2 \\ -2 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + (x) \cdot \text{det}\begin{pmatrix} x & -5 \\ -2 & 7 \end{pmatrix}$$

$$\text{det}(B) = (-2) \cdot [(-5)(0) - (2)(7)] - 0 + (x) \cdot [(x)(7) - (-5)(-2)]$$

$$\text{det}(B) = (-2) \cdot [0 - 14] + (x) \cdot [7x - 10]$$

$$\text{det}(B) = (-2) \cdot (-14) + 7x^2 - 10x$$

$$\mathbf{\text{det}(B) = 28 + 7x^2 - 10x}$$

---

## 3. Solve for $x$

Set $\text{det}(A) = \text{det}(B)$:
$$61 = 28 + 7x^2 - 10x$$

Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:
$$7x^2 - 10x + 28 - 61 = 0$$

$$\mathbf{7x^2 - 10x - 33 = 0}$$

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring by finding two numbers that multiply to $7 \times (-33) = -231$ and add up to $-10$. These numbers are $-21$ and $11$ (since $-21 \times 11 = -231$ and $-21 + 11 = -10$).

$$\begin{aligned} 7x^2 - 21x + 11x - 33 &= 0 \\ (7x^2 - 21x) + (11x - 33) &= 0 \\ 7x(x - 3) + 11(x - 3) &= 0 \\ (7x + 11)(x - 3) &= 0\end{aligned}$$

This gives two possible solutions for $x$:
1. $7x + 11 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{11}{7}$
2. $x - 3 = 0 \implies x = 3$

---

## 4. Final Answer

The problem specifies that $x$ must be a **natural number** ($\mathbf{N}$).
* $x = -\frac{11}{7}$ is not a natural number.
* $x = 3$ is a natural number.

Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\mathbf{3}$.




<img width="831" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66f7e59d-58d7-4294-8c8f-18f59847803c" />


That's a system of linear equations to solve! The key is to find the value of $a$ for which the system has **infinitely many solutions**.

Here's the system:
1.  $x - 3y + 2z = 5 - a$
2.  $3x - 4y + z = a + 1$
3.  $-3x + 9y - 6z = 2a$

## Simplifying the System

First, let's look closely at **Equation 1** and **Equation 3**.

* Equation 1: $x - 3y + 2z = 5 - a$
* Equation 3: $-3x + 9y - 6z = 2a$

Notice that the left side of Equation 3 is **$-3$ times** the left side of Equation 1:
$$-3(x - 3y + 2z) = -3x + 9y - 6z$$

For the system to have a solution (infinitely many or otherwise), Equation 3 must be consistent with Equation 1. If the left side is a multiple of the other, the right side must also be the same multiple.

$$-3x + 9y - 6z = -3(x - 3y + 2z)$$

Therefore, for consistency, the right sides must satisfy:
$$2a = -3(5 - a)$$

---

## Solving for $a$

Now, we solve this equation for $a$:
$$2a = -3(5 - a)$$
$$2a = -15 + 3a$$

Subtract $2a$ from both sides:
$$0 = -15 + 3a - 2a$$
$$0 = -15 + a$$

Add $15$ to both sides:
$$\mathbf{a = 15}$$

---

## Checking the Condition for Infinite Solutions

When a system of equations has one row that is a multiple of another, it means that the two corresponding equations represent the same plane (or a set of parallel planes, if the right sides were inconsistent).

If $\mathbf{a = 15}$, Equation 1 and Equation 3 become:

* Equation 1: $x - 3y + 2z = 5 - 15 \Rightarrow x - 3y + 2z = -10$
* Equation 3: $-3x + 9y - 6z = 2(15) \Rightarrow -3x + 9y - 6z = 30$

Check the consistency:
$$-3(x - 3y + 2z) = -3(-10) = 30$$
Since this is exactly Equation 3, the first and third equations are **linearly dependent** (they represent the same plane). This reduces the system to two independent equations:

1.  $x - 3y + 2z = -10$
2.  $3x - 4y + z = 15 + 1 \Rightarrow 3x - 4y + z = 16$

A system of two linear equations in three variables ($x, y, z$) that are not parallel or the same always has an **infinite number of solutions**, as the intersection of two non-parallel planes is a line (a set of points).

Thus, the system has infinitely many solutions if and only if **$a = 15$**.

The value of $a$ is $\mathbf{15}$.

<img width="737" height="255" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92a23e86-3ecc-4102-b072-1cd988e0914d" />

This is a problem about **linear algebra**, specifically dealing with the **span** of a set of vectors, the **subspace** it forms, and its **dimension**.

The set of vectors is $S = \{(1, -1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (2, 0, 1)\}$.

The vectors are $\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, -1, 0)$, $\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1, 1)$, and $\mathbf{v}_3 = (2, 0, 1)$.

## 1. Linear Independence and Dimension

First, determine if the set $S$ is **linearly independent** by checking if one vector can be written as a linear combination of the others. We can test this by trying to find scalars $c_1, c_2, c_3$, not all zero, such that $c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + c_3 \mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{0}$.

$c_1(1, -1, 0) + c_2(0, 1, 1) + c_3(2, 0, 1) = (0, 0, 0)$

This gives the system of linear equations:
1. $c_1 + 0c_2 + 2c_3 = 0 \implies c_1 + 2c_3 = 0$
2. $-c_1 + c_2 + 0c_3 = 0 \implies -c_1 + c_2 = 0$
3. $0c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0 \implies c_2 + c_3 = 0$

From equation (2), $c_2 = c_1$.
Substitute $c_2 = c_1$ into equation (3): $c_1 + c_3 = 0 \implies c_1 = -c_3$.
Substitute $c_1 = -c_3$ into equation (1): $(-c_3) + 2c_3 = 0 \implies c_3 = 0$.
Since $c_3 = 0$, then $c_1 = -c_3 = 0$, and $c_2 = c_1 = 0$.
The only solution is $c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0$.

Wait, let's check for a simpler relationship between the vectors directly. Let's see if $\mathbf{v}_3$ is a linear combination of $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$:
$\mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2 = (1, -1, 0) + (0, 1, 1) = (1, 0, 1)$.
This is **not** equal to $\mathbf{v}_3 = (2, 0, 1)$.

Let's re-examine the system of equations.

| Eq. | Components | Equation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | $x$ | $c_1 + 2c_3 = 0$ |
| 2 | $y$ | $-c_1 + c_2 = 0$ |
| 3 | $z$ | $c_2 + c_3 = 0$ |

From (2), $c_2 = c_1$.
From (3), $c_2 = -c_3$.
So, $c_1 = c_2 = -c_3$.

Substitute $c_1 = -c_3$ into (1):
$(-c_3) + 2c_3 = 0 \implies c_3 = 0$.
If $c_3 = 0$, then $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = 0$.
The only solution is the **trivial solution** ($c_1=c_2=c_3=0$).

Therefore, the set $S = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3\}$ is **linearly independent** (LI).

Since $S$ is a set of **three** linearly independent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$, they form a **basis** for $\mathbb{R}^3$.
The **dimension** of the space spanned by $S$ is the number of linearly independent vectors in $S$.
$$\text{dim}(\text{Span}(S)) = 3$$

---

## 2. Analyzing the Options

Based on the finding that $\text{dim}(\text{Span}(S))=3$:

### Option 4: $\text{dim}(\text{Span}(S))=3$.
This option is **Correct** ✅.

---

### Option 2: $\text{Span}(S)$ is a proper subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
A **proper subspace** means the subspace is *not* equal to the full space. Since $\text{dim}(\text{Span}(S)) = 3$ and $\text{dim}(\mathbb{R}^3) = 3$, it follows that $\text{Span}(S)$ is **equal** to $\mathbb{R}^3$ ($\text{Span}(S) = \mathbb{R}^3$).
Therefore, $\text{Span}(S)$ is **not** a proper subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
This option is **Incorrect** ❌.

---

### Option 3: $\text{Span}(S) = \text{Span}\{(1, -1, 0), (0, 1, 1)\}$.
Let $S' = \{(1, -1, 0), (0, 1, 1)\}$. This set has **two** vectors, and since they are not scalar multiples of each other, they are linearly independent.
Thus, $\text{dim}(\text{Span}(S')) = 2$.
Since $\text{dim}(\text{Span}(S)) = 3$ and $\text{dim}(\text{Span}(S')) = 2$, we have $\text{Span}(S) \neq \text{Span}(S')$.
This option is **Incorrect** ❌.

---

### Option 1: $(7, -2, 2) \in \text{Span}(S)$.
Since $\text{Span}(S) = \mathbb{R}^3$, **every** vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is in the span of $S$.
The vector $(7, -2, 2)$ is in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Therefore, $(7, -2, 2) \in \text{Span}(S)$.
This option is **Correct** ✅.

*Alternatively*, we can solve the system $c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + c_3 \mathbf{v}_3 = (7, -2, 2)$:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & | & 7 \\
-1 & 1 & 0 & | & -2 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & | & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
$R_2 \to R_2 + R_1$:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & | & 7 \\
0 & 1 & 2 & | & 5 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & | & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
$R_3 \to R_3 - R_2$:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & | & 7 \\
0 & 1 & 2 & | & 5 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & | & -3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
From $R_3$: $-c_3 = -3 \implies c_3 = 3$.
From $R_2$: $c_2 + 2c_3 = 5 \implies c_2 + 2(3) = 5 \implies c_2 = -1$.
From $R_1$: $c_1 + 2c_3 = 7 \implies c_1 + 2(3) = 7 \implies c_1 = 1$.
Since we found a unique solution $(c_1, c_2, c_3) = (1, -1, 3)$, the vector $(7, -2, 2)$ is in $\text{Span}(S)$.

---

## Conclusion

The correct set of options are:
* $(7, -2, 2) \in \text{Span}(S)$
* $\text{dim}(\text{Span}(S))=3$

The dimension of the vector space $V$ is **8**.

$V$ is the subspace of the vector space of all $3 \times 3$ matrices with real entries, denoted $M_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{R})$, where the sum of the diagonal entries (the **trace**) of the matrices is zero.

$$V = \{A \in M_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{R}) \mid \text{tr}(A) = 0\}$$

---

## **Mathematical Derivation**

### **1. Dimension of the Ambient Space**

The vector space $M_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{R})$ consists of all $3 \times 3$ matrices. A generic matrix $A$ in this space has $3 \times 3 = 9$ independent entries.
The dimension of the space of $3 \times 3$ matrices is:
$$\dim(M_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{R})) = 9$$

### **2. The Defining Condition**

The subspace $V$ is defined by the condition that the **trace** of the matrix $A$ is zero. The trace of a $3 \times 3$ matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ is the sum of its diagonal entries:
$$\text{tr}(A) = a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33}$$
The condition for a matrix to be in $V$ is:
$$a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33} = 0$$

This condition is a **single, linear, homogeneous equation** relating the entries of the matrix.

### **3. Applying the Rank-Nullity Theorem Analogue**

The set $V$ is the **null space** (or **kernel**) of the linear transformation $T: M_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by the trace:
$$T(A) = \text{tr}(A) = a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33}$$
The **image** (or **range**) of this transformation, $\text{Im}(T)$, is the set of all possible values of the trace. Since $a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33}$ can be any real numbers, their sum can also be any real number.
$$\text{Im}(T) = \mathbb{R}$$
The dimension of the image is the **rank** of the transformation:
$$\text{rank}(T) = \dim(\text{Im}(T)) = \dim(\mathbb{R}) = 1$$

The **Rank-Nullity Theorem** states:
$$\dim(\text{Domain}) = \text{rank}(T) + \text{nullity}(T)$$
Where $\text{nullity}(T) = \dim(\text{ker}(T)) = \dim(V)$.

Substituting the known values:
$$\dim(M_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{R})) = \text{rank}(T) + \dim(V)$$
$$9 = 1 + \dim(V)$$

Solving for $\dim(V)$:
$$\dim(V) = 9 - 1 = 8$$

---

## **Alternative Method (Solving for Independent Variables)**

The matrix $A \in M_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{R})$ has 9 entries.

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{pmatrix}$$

The entries that are **not** on the diagonal (six entries: $a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{21}, a_{23}, a_{31}, a_{32}$) can be chosen **freely** (6 degrees of freedom).

The entries that are on the diagonal ($a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33}$) are related by the condition:
$$a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33} = 0$$

This equation allows us to express one of the diagonal entries in terms of the others. For example, we can solve for $a_{33}$:
$$a_{33} = -a_{11} - a_{22}$$

We can choose $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$ **freely** (2 degrees of freedom), and $a_{33}$ is then determined.

The total number of independent choices (degrees of freedom) is the sum of the independent choices for the off-diagonal and diagonal entries:
$$\dim(V) = (\text{off-diagonal choices}) + (\text{diagonal independent choices})$$
$$\dim(V) = 6 + 2 = 8$$

This is a problem that asks you to determine if the given sets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, along with their defined operations, form a **vector space**. For a set to be a vector space, it must satisfy ten axioms related to vector addition and scalar multiplication.

Let's check each set individually.

## Checking $V_1$

The set is $V_1 = \{(a, b) \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$ with the operations:
* **Addition:** $(a_1, b_1) + (a_2, b_2) = (a_1 + a_2, b_1 + b_2)$
* **Scalar Multiplication:** $\alpha(a, b) = (\alpha a, \alpha b)$

$V_1$ is simply the set $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the **standard operations** of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

It is a well-known fact in linear algebra that $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard operations is a vector space. Since $V_1$ is $\mathbb{R}^2$ with standard operations, it will satisfy all ten vector space axioms.

For example, the **Zero Vector** is $(0, 0)$ since $(a, b) + (0, 0) = (a+0, b+0) = (a, b)$. The **Additive Inverse** of $(a, b)$ is $(-a, -b)$ since $(a, b) + (-a, -b) = (a-a, b-b) = (0, 0)$.

Thus, $V_1$ is a vector space with respect to the given operations.

---

## Checking $V_2$

The set is $V_2 = \{(a, b, c) \mid a, b, c \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } ab + bc = 0\}$ with the operations:
* **Addition:** $(a_1, b_1, c_1) + (a_2, b_2, c_2) = (a_1 + a_2, b_1 + b_2, c_1 + c_2)$ (Standard addition)
* **Scalar Multiplication:** $\alpha(a, b, c) = (\alpha a, \alpha b, \alpha c)$ (Standard scalar multiplication)

For $V_2$ to be a vector space, it must satisfy all ten axioms, but since its operations are the standard ones, we only need to check if $V_2$ is a **non-empty subset that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication** (i.e., it's a **subspace** of $\mathbb{R}^3$).

The condition for a vector $(a, b, c)$ to be in $V_2$ is $ab + bc = 0$, or $b(a+c) = 0$.

### 1. Closure under Addition

We need to check if $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in V_2$ for any $\mathbf{u} = (a_1, b_1, c_1) \in V_2$ and $\mathbf{v} = (a_2, b_2, c_2) \in V_2$.

* $\mathbf{u} \in V_2$ means $a_1 b_1 + b_1 c_1 = 0 \implies b_1(a_1+c_1) = 0$.
* $\mathbf{v} \in V_2$ means $a_2 b_2 + b_2 c_2 = 0 \implies b_2(a_2+c_2) = 0$.

Let $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = (a_1+a_2, b_1+b_2, c_1+c_2) = (a_3, b_3, c_3)$.
For $\mathbf{w}$ to be in $V_2$, we need $a_3 b_3 + b_3 c_3 = 0$, or $b_3(a_3+c_3) = 0$.
$b_3(a_3+c_3) = (b_1+b_2)((a_1+a_2) + (c_1+c_2))$

Let's test with a **counterexample** where closure fails:

* Let $\mathbf{u} = (1, 0, 1)$. Here, $b_1(a_1+c_1) = 0(1+1) = 0$. So $\mathbf{u} \in V_2$.
* Let $\mathbf{v} = (0, 1, 0)$. Here, $b_2(a_2+c_2) = 1(0+0) = 0$. So $\mathbf{v} \in V_2$.

Now, let's find the sum:
$\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = (1+0, 0+1, 1+0) = (1, 1, 1)$.

Does $(1, 1, 1)$ belong to $V_2$? We check the condition:
$a b + b c = (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.
Since $2 \neq 0$, the vector $(1, 1, 1)$ is **not** in $V_2$.

Since the set $V_2$ is **not closed under addition**, it **cannot be a vector space**.

---

## Conclusion

1.  $V_1$ is a vector space.
2.  $V_2$ is not a vector space.

Therefore, the correct options are:

$\square$ **$V_1$ is a vector space with respect to the given operations.**

$\square$ **$V_2$ is not a vector space with respect to the given operations.**

The correct statements from the list are the **third** and **fourth** options.

---

## Analysis of Each Statement

### 1. The set of all invertible matrices of order 2 forms a subspace of $M_2(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to usual addition and scalar multiplication.

This statement is **incorrect**.

* For a subset to be a subspace, it must contain the **zero vector** of the parent space. The zero vector in $M_2(\mathbb{R})$ is the **zero matrix** $\mathbf{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
* The zero matrix is **not invertible** because its determinant is $0$.
* Since the set of invertible matrices does not contain the zero vector, it **cannot be a subspace**.
* *Alternatively, it's not closed under addition*: The sum of two invertible matrices is not necessarily invertible. For example, $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $B = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ are both invertible, but $A+B = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is not.

### 2. The vector space $\mathbb{R}^5$ (with respect to usual additional and scalar multiplication) contains two disjoint subspaces.

This statement is **incorrect**.

* The term "disjoint" in this context usually means that the intersection of the two sets is the **empty set** ($\emptyset$).
* Every subspace must contain the **zero vector** ($\mathbf{0}$).
* Therefore, the intersection of **any two subspaces** of $\mathbb{R}^5$ must contain at least the zero vector, $\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$.
* Thus, their intersection is **never the empty set** ($\emptyset$), so no two subspaces are truly disjoint. Their intersection is at least $\{\mathbf{0}\}$.

### 3. There exist three linearly dependent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that none of the three is a multiple of another.

This statement is **correct**.

* **Linear dependence** means one vector can be written as a linear combination of the others, not necessarily a *multiple* of any single one.
* Consider the following three vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$:
    * $\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, 0, 0)$
    * $\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1, 0)$
    * $\mathbf{v}_3 = (1, 1, 0)$
* **None is a multiple of another:** $\mathbf{v}_1$ is not a multiple of $\mathbf{v}_2$ or $\mathbf{v}_3$; $\mathbf{v}_2$ is not a multiple of $\mathbf{v}_1$ or $\mathbf{v}_3$, etc.
* **They are linearly dependent:** $\mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{v}_1 + \mathbf{v}_2$. This shows a non-trivial linear combination that equals the zero vector: $1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_1 + 1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_2 - 1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{0}$.

### 4. Union of two linearly independent sets need not be linearly independent.

This statement is **correct**.

* Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two linearly independent sets. The union $S_1 \cup S_2$ is not necessarily linearly independent if there is a linear dependence *between* a vector in $S_1$ and vectors in $S_2$.
* **Example:**
    * Let $S_1 = \{(1, 0)\}$ be a set in $\mathbb{R}^2$. $S_1$ is linearly independent.
    * Let $S_2 = \{(2, 0)\}$ be a set in $\mathbb{R}^2$. $S_2$ is linearly independent.
    * The **union** is $S_1 \cup S_2 = \{(1, 0), (2, 0)\}$.
    * This union is **linearly dependent** because $(2, 0) = 2 \cdot (1, 0)$.

Therefore, the union of two linearly independent sets can be linearly dependent.

Based on the properties of **maximal linear independent sets** and **minimal spanning sets** in a vector space $V$, the following options are true:

* **Option 3:** For any $v \in V \setminus S_1$, $S_1 \cup \{v\}$ is a linearly dependent set.
* **Option 4:** For any $v \in V$, $S_2 \cup \{v\}$ is a spanning set of $V$.

The options are presented as checkboxes, implying there may be one or more correct answers.

---

## Explanation

The problem revolves around the concept of a **basis** for a vector space $V$.

A set $B$ is a **basis** for $V$ if and only if it satisfies **both** of the following conditions:
1.  $B$ is **linearly independent**.
2.  $B$ **spans** $V$.

### Properties of $S_1$ (Maximal Linear Independent Set)

$S_1$ is a **maximal linear independent set**. This means:
1.  $S_1$ is **linearly independent**.
2.  Any set $S_1' \supset S_1$ (a proper superset of $S_1$) is **linearly dependent**.

A maximal linearly independent set in a vector space $V$ is always a **basis** for $V$. Therefore, **$S_1$ is a basis for $V$**.

### Properties of $S_2$ (Minimal Spanning Set)

$S_2$ is a **minimal spanning set** of $V$. This means:
1.  $S_2$ **spans** $V$.
2.  Any set $S_2' \subset S_2$ (a proper subset of $S_2$) does **not** span $V$.

A minimal spanning set of a vector space $V$ is always a **basis** for $V$. Therefore, **$S_2$ is a basis for $V$**. 
---

## Analysis of the Options

### Option 1: For any $v \in S_1$, $S_1 \setminus \{v\}$ is linearly independent.
* **False**. Since $S_1$ is a basis, it's linearly independent. If $V$ is not the zero vector space (which is typical for these problems), $S_1$ has at least one vector. $S_1 \setminus \{v\}$ is a **proper subset** of the linearly independent set $S_1$. While any subset of a linearly independent set is also linearly independent, this option is likely meant to test whether $S_1 \setminus \{v\}$ *could* be a basis or is somehow unique. The property being tested here is usually related to **minimality**, which $S_1$ doesn't necessarily have with respect to linear independence (a proper subset of $S_1$ is still independent). *However, an even stronger argument against this option being the intended answer is that it's a true statement that holds for ANY linearly independent set, but it doesn't characterize $S_1$ as **maximal***. For maximal sets, we look at supersets.

### Option 2: For any $v \in S_2$, $S_2 \setminus \{v\}$ is a spanning set of $V$.
* **False**. $S_2$ is a **minimal spanning set** (a basis). By definition of minimality, removing any vector $v$ from $S_2$ results in a set that **no longer spans** $V$.

### Option 3: For any $v \in V \setminus S_1$, $S_1 \cup \{v\}$ is a linearly dependent set.
* **True**. This is the direct implication of $S_1$ being a **maximal linear independent set**. Any proper superset of a maximal linearly independent set must be linearly dependent. Since $v \in V \setminus S_1$, $v$ is not in $S_1$, so $S_1 \cup \{v\}$ is a proper superset of $S_1$ (assuming $v \neq 0$). Thus, $S_1 \cup \{v\}$ is linearly dependent.

### Option 4: For any $v \in V$, $S_2 \cup \{v\}$ is a spanning set of $V$.
* **True**. Since $S_2$ is a **spanning set** of $V$ (it's a basis), adding **any** vector $v$ from $V$ (or even outside $V$) to $S_2$ will result in a set that still spans $V$. This is because the span of $S_2 \cup \{v\}$ will contain all the vectors in $\text{span}(S_2)$ and the vector $v$. Since $\text{span}(S_2) = V$ and $v \in V$, the new set still spans all of $V$. This also reflects the property of $S_2$ being a **minimal** spanning set—it cannot be made *smaller* and still span $V$, but it can be made *larger*.

This is a question about **linear independence** and **linear dependence** in a vector space, specifically $\mathbb{R}^2$. Let's analyze each statement.

## Statement 1 Analysis

**Statement 1:** $0(0,0) + 0(1,1) = (0,0)$ implies that the set $\{(0,0), (1,1)\}$ is a **linearly independent** subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

### **Recall the Definition of Linear Independence**

A set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k\}$ is **linearly independent** if the only solution to the vector equation:
$$c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k = \mathbf{0}$$
is the **trivial solution**, where $c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_k = 0$.

### **Applying the Definition to Statement 1**

The vectors are $\mathbf{v}_1 = (0,0)$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = (1,1)$. The vector equation is:
$$c_1(0,0) + c_2(1,1) = (0,0)$$
This simplifies to:
$$(c_1 \cdot 0 + c_2 \cdot 1, c_1 \cdot 0 + c_2 \cdot 1) = (0,0)$$
$$(c_2, c_2) = (0,0)$$
This means $c_2 = 0$.

Now, let's consider the coefficient $c_1$. The equation becomes:
$$c_1(0,0) + 0(1,1) = (0,0)$$
$$c_1(0,0) + (0,0) = (0,0)$$
$$(0,0) = (0,0)$$

This equation is true for **any value of $c_1$**. For example, $c_1=5$ and $c_2=0$ is a **non-trivial solution** because $c_1 \neq 0$.

Since there are **non-trivial solutions** (where at least one coefficient is non-zero), the set $\{(0,0), (1,1)\}$ is **linearly dependent**.

***
**Conclusion for Statement 1:** The statement is **false**. The presence of the zero vector $\mathbf{0}$ in any set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k\}$ *always* guarantees linear dependence, as you can set the coefficient of $\mathbf{0}$ to any non-zero value and all other coefficients to zero, creating a non-trivial solution.
***

---

## Statement 2 Analysis

**Statement 2:** $2(1,0) + 2(0,1) = (2,2)$ implies that the set $\{(1,0), (0,1), (2,2)\}$ is a **linearly dependent** subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

### **Recall the Definition of Linear Dependence**

A set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k\}$ is **linearly dependent** if there exists a **non-trivial solution** to the vector equation:
$$c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k = \mathbf{0}$$

### **Alternative Definition: Linear Combination**

A set of vectors is **linearly dependent** if at least one vector in the set can be written as a **linear combination** of the others.

### **Applying the Definition to Statement 2**

The vectors are $\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,0)$, $\mathbf{v}_2 = (0,1)$, and $\mathbf{v}_3 = (2,2)$.

The given equation is:
$$2(1,0) + 2(0,1) = (2,2)$$

This equation shows that the vector $\mathbf{v}_3 = (2,2)$ is a **linear combination** of the vectors $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$.

$$2\mathbf{v}_1 + 2\mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_3$$

Now, we can rearrange this equation to form the linear dependence equation $\mathbf{0}$:
$$2\mathbf{v}_1 + 2\mathbf{v}_2 - 1\mathbf{v}_3 = \mathbf{0}$$
$$2(1,0) + 2(0,1) + (-1)(2,2) = (0,0)$$

The coefficients are $c_1=2$, $c_2=2$, and $c_3=-1$. Since $c_1, c_2, c_3$ are **not all zero** (e.g., $c_3 = -1 \neq 0$), this is a **non-trivial solution** to the linear dependence equation.

Therefore, the set $\{(1,0), (0,1), (2,2)\}$ is **linearly dependent**.

***
**Conclusion for Statement 2:** The statement is **true**. A set containing a vector that is a linear combination of the others is, by definition, linearly dependent.
***

---

## Final Conclusion

* **Statement 1 is false.**
* **Statement 2 is true.**

The correct option is: **Statement 2 is true, but Statement 1 is false.**




<img width="1399" height="496" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5642d84-ba75-45ca-9986-b8ff24d21d14" />


Based on the given data, let's solve the two questions.

The problem describes three people, $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$, buying rolls, buns, and cakes.
Let:
* $x_1$ be the cost per unit of **rolls** (in ₹).
* $x_2$ be the cost per unit of **buns** (in ₹).
* $x_3$ be the cost per unit of **cakes** (in ₹).

The purchases and total costs are:

* **$P_1$:** 1 unit of rolls, 2 units of buns, 3 units of cakes. Total cost: ₹16.
    $$1x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 16$$
* **$P_2$:** 2 units of rolls, 4 units of buns, 5 units of cakes. Total cost: ₹29.
    $$2x_1 + 4x_2 + 5x_3 = 29$$
* **$P_3$:** 1 unit of rolls, 3 units of buns, 4 units of cakes. Total cost: ₹21.
    $$1x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_3 = 21$$

## 12) Matrix Representation and Cofactor

### Matrix Form $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$

The system of linear equations is:
$$
\begin{align*} 1x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 &= 16 \\ 2x_1 + 4x_2 + 5x_3 &= 29 \\ 1x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_3 &= 21 \end{align*}
$$

In the matrix form $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, where $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 16 \\ 29 \\ 21 \end{bmatrix}$, the coefficient matrix $A$ is formed by the coefficients of $x_1, x_2, x_3$:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 & 5 \\ 1 & 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$

---

### $(2, 2)$-th Cofactor of $A$

The **cofactor** $C_{ij}$ of an element $a_{ij}$ in matrix $A$ is given by the formula:
$$C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ij}$$
where $M_{ij}$ is the **minor**, which is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.

For the $(2, 2)$-th cofactor, we have $i=2$ and $j=2$.

1.  **Find the minor $M_{22}$:** Delete the 2nd row and 2nd column of $A$:
    $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \xcancel{2} & 3 \\ \xcancel{2} & \xcancel{4} & \xcancel{5} \\ 1 & \xcancel{3} & 4 \end{bmatrix} \implies M_{22} = \det \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$
    $$M_{22} = (1)(4) - (3)(1) = 4 - 3 = 1$$

2.  **Calculate the cofactor $C_{22}$:**
    $$C_{22} = (-1)^{2+2} M_{22} = (-1)^4 (1) = (1)(1) = 1$$

The **$(2, 2)$-th cofactor of $A$ is 1**.

---

## 13) Value of $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$

We need to solve the system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ for $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and then find their sum.

$$
\begin{align} x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 &= 16 \quad &(1) \\ 2x_1 + 4x_2 + 5x_3 &= 29 \quad &(2) \\ x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_3 &= 21 \quad &(3) \end{align}
$$

**Step 1: Simplify the system.**

Subtract equation (1) from equation (3):
$$(x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_3) - (x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3) = 21 - 16$$
$$x_2 + x_3 = 5 \quad &(4)$$

Multiply equation (1) by 2 and subtract it from equation (2):
$$2 \times (1) \implies 2x_1 + 4x_2 + 6x_3 = 32 \quad &(5)$$
$$(2x_1 + 4x_2 + 5x_3) - (2x_1 + 4x_2 + 6x_3) = 29 - 32$$
$$-x_3 = -3$$
$$x_3 = 3$$

**Step 2: Solve for $x_2$.**

Substitute $x_3 = 3$ into equation (4):
$$x_2 + 3 = 5$$
$$x_2 = 5 - 3$$
$$x_2 = 2$$

**Step 3: Solve for $x_1$.**

Substitute $x_2 = 2$ and $x_3 = 3$ into equation (1):
$$x_1 + 2(2) + 3(3) = 16$$
$$x_1 + 4 + 9 = 16$$
$$x_1 + 13 = 16$$
$$x_1 = 16 - 13$$
$$x_1 = 3$$

**Step 4: Find the sum $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$.**

$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 3 + 2 + 3 = 8$$

The value of $\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}$ is $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$, and the sum $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$ is **8**.

This problem deals with finding the maximum and minimum possible rank of a product of matrices, $D = ABC$.

## Background: Rank of a Matrix Product

The key theorem governing the rank of a product of matrices is:

For matrices $A$ (size $m \times n$) and $B$ (size $n \times p$) such that the product $AB$ is defined, the rank of the product satisfies **Sylvester's Law of Nullity** (also known as a part of the **Rank-Nullity Theorem for products**) and the **Inequalities for Rank of a Product**:

1.  **Upper Bound (General)**:
    $$\text{rank}(AB) \le \min(\text{rank}(A), \text{rank}(B))$$
2.  **Lower Bound (Sylvester's Inequality)**:
    $$\text{rank}(AB) \ge \text{rank}(A) + \text{rank}(B) - n$$
    where $n$ is the number of columns of $A$ (and rows of $B$).

For a product of three matrices $D = ABC$, we can apply the inequalities sequentially.

## Given Matrices and Product

The matrices are:
* $A \in M_{7 \times 12}(\mathbb{R})$ (size $7 \times 12$)
* $B \in M_{12 \times 3}(\mathbb{R})$ (size $12 \times 3$)
* $C \in M_{3 \times 3}(\mathbb{R})$ (size $3 \times 3$)

The product matrix is $D = ABC$.
The size of $D$ is $7 \times 3$ because $(7 \times 12) \times (12 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3) \rightarrow 7 \times 3$.
Since $D$ is a $7 \times 3$ matrix, its rank must satisfy:
$$\text{rank}(D) \le \min(7, 3) = 3$$

---

## 14) Find the maximum possible rank of $(D)$

We use the upper bound inequality for the rank of a product:
$$\text{rank}(D) = \text{rank}(ABC) \le \min(\text{rank}(A), \text{rank}(BC))$$
$$\text{rank}(D) \le \text{rank}(A) \le \min(7, 12) = 7$$
And
$$\text{rank}(BC) \le \min(\text{rank}(B), \text{rank}(C))$$
So, $\text{rank}(D) \le \text{rank}(BC) \le \text{rank}(B) \le \min(12, 3) = 3$
And $\text{rank}(D) \le \text{rank}(BC) \le \text{rank}(C) \le \min(3, 3) = 3$

Combining these, the rank of $D$ must satisfy:
$$\text{rank}(D) \le \min(\text{rank}(A), \text{rank}(B), \text{rank}(C))$$
However, we can state a stronger, more direct inequality based on the dimensions:
$$\text{rank}(D) \le \min(\text{rows of } D, \text{columns of } D) = \min(7, 3) = 3$$

The maximum possible rank for any $7 \times 3$ matrix is **3**.

We must check if this rank is *achievable* for *some* choices of $A, B, C$.
To maximize the rank, we assume $A, B, C$ have their maximum possible ranks:
* $\max(\text{rank}(A)) = \min(7, 12) = 7$
* $\max(\text{rank}(B)) = \min(12, 3) = 3$
* $\max(\text{rank}(C)) = \min(3, 3) = 3$

Let's try to achieve $\text{rank}(D) = 3$.
1.  Choose **$C$** to be the $3 \times 3$ **Identity Matrix** $I_3$. $\text{rank}(C) = 3$.
    $$C = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
2.  Choose **$B$** to be a matrix with $\text{rank}(B) = 3$.
    Let $B$ be a $12 \times 3$ matrix whose first three rows form $I_3$ and the rest are zero:
    $$B = \begin{pmatrix} I_3 \\ 0_{9 \times 3} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
    Then $\text{rank}(BC) = \text{rank}(B I_3) = \text{rank}(B) = 3$.
3.  Choose **$A$** to be a matrix with $\text{rank}(A) = 7$.
    Let $A$ be a $7 \times 12$ matrix whose first seven columns form a $7 \times 7$ identity matrix $I_7$, and the remaining columns are zero:
    $$A = \begin{pmatrix} I_7 & 0_{7 \times 5} \end{pmatrix}$$
    Then
    $$D = ABC = \begin{pmatrix} I_7 & 0_{7 \times 5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} I_3 \\ 0_{9 \times 3} \end{pmatrix} I_3$$
    The product $\begin{pmatrix} I_7 & 0_{7 \times 5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} I_3 \\ 0_{9 \times 3} \end{pmatrix}$ results in a $7 \times 3$ matrix $D'$.
    The first three columns of $\begin{pmatrix} I_7 & 0_{7 \times 5} \end{pmatrix}$ are multiplied by the first three rows of $\begin{pmatrix} I_3 \\ 0_{9 \times 3} \end{pmatrix}$, which are $I_3$.
    $$D = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}_{7 \times 3}$$
    This matrix has a rank of **3**.

Since $\text{rank}(D) \le 3$ and a rank of 3 is achievable, the maximum possible rank of $D$ is **3**.

**Maximum possible rank of $D$ is 3.**

## 15) Find the minimum possible rank of $(D)$

The problem states that $D$ is a **non-zero matrix**. This means that $\text{rank}(D)$ cannot be 0.
$$\text{rank}(D) \ge 1$$

We check if a rank of **1** is achievable. To achieve the minimum rank, we can choose matrices $A, B, C$ that are all rank 1.

1.  Choose **$A$** to be a $7 \times 12$ rank 1 matrix.
    $$A = \mathbf{u}_7 \mathbf{v}_{12}^T$$
    Let $\mathbf{u}_7 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T$ (standard basis vector $e_1$) and $\mathbf{v}_{12}^T = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ (row of all ones).
    $$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
2.  Choose **$B$** to be a $12 \times 3$ rank 1 matrix.
    $$B = \mathbf{w}_{12} \mathbf{x}_3^T$$
    Let $\mathbf{w}_{12} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T$ and $\mathbf{x}_3^T = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
    $$B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
3.  Choose **$C$** to be a $3 \times 3$ rank 1 matrix.
    $$C = \mathbf{y}_3 \mathbf{z}_3^T$$
    Let $\mathbf{y}_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T$ and $\mathbf{z}_3^T = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
    $$C = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

Now we compute the product $D = ABC$.
$$BC = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}_{12 \times 3} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}_{3 \times 3} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}_{12 \times 3} \text{ (Rank 1)}$$
The product $ABC$ is:
$$D = A (BC) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \end{pmatrix}_{7 \times 12} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}_{12 \times 3}$$
Multiplying the first row of $A$ by the column vectors of $BC$:
$$D = \begin{pmatrix} 1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 0 + \dots & 1\cdot 0 + 1\cdot 0 + \dots & 1\cdot 0 + 1\cdot 0 + \dots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}_{7 \times 3} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}_{7 \times 3}$$
This matrix $D$ is **non-zero** and has a rank of **1**.

Since $\text{rank}(D) \ge 1$ and a rank of 1 is achievable, the minimum possible rank of $D$ is **1**.

**Minimum possible rank of $D$ is 1.**
