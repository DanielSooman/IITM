The correct moment generating function (MGF) for the random variable $S = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$ is the third option:
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(\frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}\right)^3$$
---
## How to Find the MGF

### Step 1: Understand the Moment Generating Function
The moment generating function, or MGF, of a random variable **X** is defined as $M_X(\lambda) = E[e^{\lambda X}]$. It's a useful tool in probability theory because it uniquely determines the probability distribution of a random variable and can simplify calculations involving sums of independent random variables.

### Step 2: Find the MGF of a Single Uniform Random Variable
The random variable **X** is uniformly distributed on the set $\{-0.2, 0.2\}$. This means that X can take on two values, $-0.2$ and $0.2$, each with a probability of $1/2$.
So, the MGF of a single random variable **X** is:
$$M_X(\lambda) = E[e^{\lambda X}] = \sum_{x \in \{-0.2, 0.2\}} e^{\lambda x} P(X=x)$$
$$M_X(\lambda) = e^{\lambda(-0.2)} \cdot P(X=-0.2) + e^{\lambda(0.2)} \cdot P(X=0.2)$$
Since the probabilities are equal, $P(X=-0.2) = P(X=0.2) = 1/2$.
$$M_X(\lambda) = e^{-0.2\lambda} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + e^{0.2\lambda} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}$$

### Step 3: Find the MGF for the Sum of Independent and Identically Distributed Random Variables
The problem states that $X_1, X_2,$ and $X_3$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This is a crucial piece of information because it simplifies finding the MGF of their sum. For i.i.d. random variables, the MGF of their sum is the product of their individual MGFs.
$$M_S(\lambda) = M_{X_1+X_2+X_3}(\lambda) = M_{X_1}(\lambda) \cdot M_{X_2}(\lambda) \cdot M_{X_3}(\lambda)$$
Since they are identically distributed, their MGFs are all the same: $M_{X_1}(\lambda) = M_{X_2}(\lambda) = M_{X_3}(\lambda) = M_X(\lambda)$.
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(M_X(\lambda)\right)^3$$
Substituting the expression for $M_X(\lambda)$ we found in the previous step:
$$M_S(\lambda) = \left(\frac{e^{-0.2\lambda} + e^{0.2\lambda}}{2}\right)^3$$
This matches the third option provided in the problem.

The level of significance is given by the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true. For the given problem, this is the probability that $T < c$ under the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 4$.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution

Under the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 4$, the sample mean $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{100}\sum_{i=1}^{100} X_i$ is normally distributed with a mean of $\mu_0 = 4$ and a variance of $\sigma^2/n = 36/100 = 0.36$. So, $\bar{X} \sim \text{Normal}(4, 0.36)$.

The test statistic is defined as $T = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_{100}}{100} = \bar{X}$. The test rejects $H_0$ if $T < c$. The level of significance, denoted by $\alpha$, is the probability of this event occurring when $H_0$ is true.

$\alpha = P(T < c | H_0 \text{ is true}) = P(\bar{X} < c | \mu = 4)$.

To find this probability, we standardize the random variable $\bar{X}$ to a standard normal variable $Z$. The formula for standardization is $Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_{\bar{X}}}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}}$, where $\mu_{\bar{X}} = 4$ and $\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \sqrt{0.36} = 0.6$.

$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - 4}{0.6}$.

Now, we can express the probability in terms of $Z$:

$\alpha = P\left(\frac{\bar{X} - 4}{0.6} < \frac{c - 4}{0.6}\right) = P\left(Z < \frac{c - 4}{0.6}\right)$.

Let $F_Z(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal variable $Z$. Then, $P(Z < z) = F_Z(z)$.

Therefore, $\alpha = F_Z\left(\frac{c - 4}{0.6}\right)$.

To match the options provided, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

$\frac{c - 4}{0.6} = \frac{c - 4}{6/10} = \frac{10(c - 4)}{6} = \frac{5(c - 4)}{3} = \frac{5c - 20}{3}$.

So, the level of significance is $\alpha = F_Z\left(\frac{5c - 20}{3}\right)$.

This corresponds to the **fourth option** in the provided image.

Based on the scenario, the correct test statistic is the sample mean and the appropriate hypothesis test is the **t-test**.

---

### **Explanation**

The image describes a situation where we're observing samples from a **normal distribution** and the **population variance is unknown**. We want to check if the mean is greater than a certain value, $\mu$. This is a classic hypothesis testing problem.

* **Test Statistic**: The test statistic is a value calculated from sample data during a hypothesis test. Its purpose is to help us decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. Since the question is about the population mean, the appropriate test statistic to use is the **sample mean**, denoted by $\bar{x}$ or, as shown in the options, $T = \text{Sample mean}$.
* **Hypothesis Test**: The choice of hypothesis test depends on what information we have.
    * A **z-test** is used when the population variance is known.
    * A **$\chi^2$-test** is typically used for testing hypotheses about the population variance.
    * A **t-test** is used when the population variance is unknown, which is exactly the case described in the problem. The t-test uses the sample standard deviation as an estimate for the population standard deviation, making it suitable for this scenario.

Therefore, the combination of the sample mean as the test statistic and the t-test as the hypothesis test is the correct choice.

The method of moments is a technique used to estimate population parameters. The core idea is to equate the theoretical moments of a distribution to the corresponding sample moments.

---

### Understanding the Exponential Distribution

The **exponential distribution** is a continuous probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process. The probability density function (PDF) is given by:
$f(x; \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x \ge 0$.

The **mean** of an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$ is $\frac{1}{\lambda}$. This is also the first theoretical moment.

---

### Calculating the Sample Mean

The first sample moment is simply the sample mean. We are given a sample of 6 delivery times in hours: 15, 20, 15, 16, 14, 20.

The **sample mean** ($\bar{x}$) is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values:
$\bar{x} = \frac{15 + 20 + 15 + 16 + 14 + 20}{6} = \frac{100}{6} \approx 16.67$

---

### Applying the Method of Moments

To find the method of moment estimate of $\lambda$, we equate the first theoretical moment to the first sample moment:
**Theoretical Mean** = **Sample Mean**
$\frac{1}{\lambda} = \bar{x}$

Now, we can solve for the estimated value of $\lambda$, which we'll denote as $\hat{\lambda}$:
$\hat{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\bar{x}}$
$\hat{\lambda} = \frac{1}{16.67} \approx 0.06$

Rounding to two decimal places, the estimate for $\lambda$ is **0.06**.



<img width="1008" height="453" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a2020e5-04a1-402c-9a1a-9972623941aa" />


To find the value of $k$ for which $\hat{\mu}_2$ is an **unbiased estimator** of $\mu$, we need to ensure that the expected value of $\hat{\mu}_2$ is equal to $\mu$.

Given the formula for $\hat{\mu}_2$:
$$\hat{\mu}_2 = \frac{\hat{\mu}_1 - k}{(k-1)}$$
And the expected value of $\hat{\mu}_1$:
$$E(\hat{\mu}_1) = 2\mu + 3$$

The condition for $\hat{\mu}_2$ to be unbiased is $E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \mu$. Let's calculate the expected value of $\hat{\mu}_2$:
$$E(\hat{\mu}_2) = E\left(\frac{\hat{\mu}_1 - k}{k-1}\right)$$
Using the properties of expectation, we can separate the terms:
$$E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \frac{1}{k-1} E(\hat{\mu}_1 - k)$$
$$E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \frac{1}{k-1} [E(\hat{\mu}_1) - E(k)]$$
Since $k$ is a constant, its expected value is just $k$:
$$E(k) = k$$
Now, substitute the given expression for $E(\hat{\mu}_1)$:
$$E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \frac{1}{k-1} [(2\mu + 3) - k]$$
For $\hat{\mu}_2$ to be an unbiased estimator of $\mu$, we must have $E(\hat{\mu}_2) = \mu$. So, we set the equation equal to $\mu$:
$$\mu = \frac{2\mu + 3 - k}{k-1}$$
Now, we solve for $k$:
$$\mu(k-1) = 2\mu + 3 - k$$
$$\mu k - \mu = 2\mu + 3 - k$$
Rearrange the terms to group all terms with $\mu$ on one side and terms with $k$ and constants on the other side:
$$\mu k - 2\mu - \mu = 3 - k$$
This is incorrect. Let's start over from:
$$\mu k - \mu = 2\mu + 3 - k$$
We want to isolate $k$. Let's move all terms with $k$ to one side and terms with $\mu$ to the other:
$$\mu k + k = 2\mu + 3 + \mu$$
Factor out $k$ from the left side and combine terms on the right side:
$$k(\mu + 1) = 3\mu + 3$$
$$k(\mu + 1) = 3(\mu + 1)$$
Assuming $\mu + 1 \neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $(\mu+1)$:
$$k = 3$$
The value of $k$ that makes $\hat{\mu}_2$ an unbiased estimator of $\mu$ is **3**. This matches the provided "Accepted Answer."

## Finding the Method of Moments Estimate of $p$

The method of moments estimate for a parameter is found by setting the sample moments equal to the population moments. For this problem, we'll use the first moment, the mean.

### Step 1: Calculate the population mean ($E[X]$)

The population mean for a discrete random variable is the sum of each value multiplied by its probability:
$E[X] = \sum x \cdot P(X=x)$
$E[X] = (0 \cdot \frac{p}{4}) + (1 \cdot \frac{p}{4}) + (2 \cdot \frac{p}{4}) + (3 \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4}))$
$E[X] = 0 + \frac{p}{4} + \frac{2p}{4} + 3 - \frac{9p}{4}$
$E[X] = 3 + \frac{3p-9p}{4} = 3 - \frac{6p}{4} = 3 - \frac{3p}{2}$

### Step 2: Calculate the sample mean ($\bar{x}$)

The sample is given as $(0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 0)$. There are 9 data points.
$\bar{x} = \frac{0+3+2+2+3+1+2+3+0}{9} = \frac{16}{9} \approx 1.777...$

### Step 3: Set the population mean equal to the sample mean and solve for $p$

$E[X] = \bar{x}$
$3 - \frac{3p}{2} = \frac{16}{9}$
$3 - \frac{16}{9} = \frac{3p}{2}$
$\frac{27-16}{9} = \frac{3p}{2}$
$\frac{11}{9} = \frac{3p}{2}$
$11 \cdot 2 = 3p \cdot 9$
$22 = 27p$
$p = \frac{22}{27} \approx 0.8148...$

Rounding to one decimal place, the method of moments estimate for $p$ is **0.8**.

---

## Finding the Maximum Likelihood Estimate of $p$

The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is the value of the parameter that maximizes the likelihood function.

### Step 1: Write the Likelihood Function ($L(p|x)$)

The likelihood function is the product of the probabilities of observing each data point in the sample. The sample is given as $(0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3)$. Let $n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3$ be the number of times each value appears in the sample.
$n_0 = 2$ (for the value 0)
$n_1 = 1$ (for the value 1)
$n_2 = 2$ (for the value 2)
$n_3 = 4$ (for the value 3)

The total sample size is $n = n_0 + n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 2+1+2+4 = 9$.

$L(p|x) = [P(X=0)]^{n_0} \cdot [P(X=1)]^{n_1} \cdot [P(X=2)]^{n_2} \cdot [P(X=3)]^{n_3}$
$L(p|x) = (\frac{p}{4})^2 \cdot (\frac{p}{4})^1 \cdot (\frac{p}{4})^2 \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4})^4$
$L(p|x) = (\frac{p}{4})^{2+1+2} \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4})^4 = (\frac{p}{4})^5 \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4})^4$

### Step 2: Find the Log-Likelihood Function ($\ln L(p|x)$)

It's easier to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood function.
$\ln L(p|x) = \ln[(\frac{p}{4})^5 \cdot (1 - \frac{3p}{4})^4]$
$\ln L(p|x) = 5 \ln(\frac{p}{4}) + 4 \ln(1 - \frac{3p}{4})$
$\ln L(p|x) = 5(\ln p - \ln 4) + 4 \ln(1 - \frac{3p}{4})$

### Step 3: Differentiate with respect to $p$ and set the derivative equal to zero

$\frac{d}{dp} \ln L(p|x) = \frac{d}{dp} [5(\ln p - \ln 4) + 4 \ln(1 - \frac{3p}{4})]$
$\frac{d}{dp} \ln L(p|x) = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{p} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{(1 - \frac{3p}{4})} \cdot (-\frac{3}{4})$
$\frac{d}{dp} \ln L(p|x) = \frac{5}{p} - \frac{3}{(1 - \frac{3p}{4})}$

Setting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:
$\frac{5}{p} - \frac{3}{(1 - \frac{3p}{4})} = 0$
$\frac{5}{p} = \frac{3}{(1 - \frac{3p}{4})}$
$5(1 - \frac{3p}{4}) = 3p$
$5 - \frac{15p}{4} = 3p$
$5 = 3p + \frac{15p}{4}$
$5 = \frac{12p+15p}{4}$
$5 = \frac{27p}{4}$
$20 = 27p$
$p = \frac{20}{27} \approx 0.7407...$

Rounding to two decimal places, the maximum likelihood estimate for $p$ is **0.74**.

Based on the provided images, the problem asks to find the posterior distribution and the posterior mean of the parameter $\theta$ for a discrete random variable $X$.

## Posterior Distribution of $\theta$

The problem specifies a discrete random variable $X$ with values $\{1, 3, 5\}$ and corresponding probabilities $\{\frac{\theta}{2}, 1-\theta, \frac{\theta}{2}\}$. The parameter $\theta$ is in the range $[0, 1]$. We are given a sample of observations: $\{1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 5\}$.

First, let's count the frequency of each value in the sample:
- Number of times $X=1$: 4
- Number of times $X=3$: 3
- Number of times $X=5$: 3
The total sample size is 10.

The **likelihood function** for the sample is the product of the probabilities of each observation:
$L(\theta | \text{data}) = P(X=1)^4 \cdot P(X=3)^3 \cdot P(X=5)^3$
$L(\theta | \text{data}) = (\frac{\theta}{2})^4 \cdot (1-\theta)^3 \cdot (\frac{\theta}{2})^3$
$L(\theta | \text{data}) = (\frac{\theta}{2})^7 \cdot (1-\theta)^3 = \frac{1}{2^7} \theta^7 (1-\theta)^3$

The **prior distribution** of $\theta$ is given as a Beta distribution, Beta($\alpha_0, \beta_0$) with $\alpha_0 = 5$ and $\beta_0 = 6$. The probability density function (PDF) of the prior is:
$f(\theta) \propto \theta^{\alpha_0 - 1} (1-\theta)^{\beta_0 - 1} = \theta^{5-1} (1-\theta)^{6-1} = \theta^4 (1-\theta)^5$

According to **Bayes' theorem**, the posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:
$f(\theta | \text{data}) \propto L(\theta | \text{data}) \cdot f(\theta)$
$f(\theta | \text{data}) \propto (\frac{1}{2^7} \theta^7 (1-\theta)^3) \cdot (\theta^4 (1-\theta)^5)$
$f(\theta | \text{data}) \propto \theta^{7+4} (1-\theta)^{3+5} = \theta^{11} (1-\theta)^8$

This posterior PDF has the form of a **Beta distribution** with parameters $\alpha_1 = 11+1 = 12$ and $\beta_1 = 8+1 = 9$.
Therefore, the posterior distribution of $\theta$ is **Beta(12, 9)**. This corresponds to the third option in the provided image.

---

## Posterior Mean of $\theta$

The mean of a **Beta distribution**, Beta($\alpha, \beta$), is given by the formula:
$E(\theta) = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$

For the posterior distribution Beta(12, 9), the posterior mean is:
Posterior Mean $= \frac{12}{12 + 9} = \frac{12}{21}$

To express this as a decimal rounded to two places:
Posterior Mean $= \frac{12}{21} \approx 0.5714...$

Rounding to two decimal places, we get **0.57**. This value falls within the accepted range of 0.54 to 0.60 shown in the image.

Based on the provided images, here is a step-by-step analysis of the hypothesis test.

---

### **Formulating Hypotheses**

First, we need to formulate the **null hypothesis** ($H_0$) and the **alternative hypothesis** ($H_A$).
* The university's claim is that the average time ($\mu$) is 60 minutes. This forms our null hypothesis: $H_0: \mu = 60$.
* The analyst believes the average time is **less than** 60 minutes. This forms our alternative hypothesis: $H_A: \mu < 60$.

Therefore, the correct hypothesis choice is $H_0: \mu = 60, H_A: \mu < 60$.

---

### **Calculating the Test Statistic**

Next, we calculate the **Z-score** to determine how many standard deviations the sample mean is from the population mean. We'll use the formula:
$$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$

Given the values from the problem:
* Sample mean ($\bar{x}$) = 59.3 minutes
* Population mean ($\mu$) = 60 minutes
* Population standard deviation ($\sigma$) = 5 minutes
* Sample size ($n$) = 100

Plugging these values into the formula:
$$Z = \frac{59.3 - 60}{5 / \sqrt{100}}$$$$Z = \frac{-0.7}{5 / 10}$$$$Z = \frac{-0.7}{0.5}$$
$$Z = -1.4$$

Our calculated Z-statistic is **-1.4**.

---

### **Determining the Conclusion**

Now, we compare the calculated Z-statistic to the critical values for the specified significance levels. Since this is a **left-tailed test** ($H_A: \mu < 60$), the critical region is in the left tail of the standard normal distribution. 
* **Significance level $\alpha = 0.05$**: The critical value for a one-tailed test is **-1.645**. Our calculated Z-score of **-1.4** is **greater than** -1.645. Since the test statistic does not fall into the rejection region (i.e., it's not less than -1.645), we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. Thus, we **accept** $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$.

* **Significance level $\alpha = 0.01$**: The critical value for a one-tailed test is **-2.33**. Our calculated Z-score of **-1.4** is **greater than** -2.33. Since the test statistic does not fall into the rejection region (i.e., it's not less than -2.33), we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. Thus, we **accept** $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.01$.

Since we fail to reject the null hypothesis at both significance levels, the correct conclusions are:
* **Accept $H_0$ at significance level $\alpha = 0.05$**
* **Accept $H_0$ at significance level $\alpha = 0.01$**

Based on the images provided, let's solve the two subquestions related to the exponential distribution.

---

### Part 1: Finding $P(10 \leq X \leq 15)$

The first image provides a problem where a random variable $X$ follows an **exponential distribution** with a mean of 5. The prompt asks to find the value of $P(10 \leq X \leq 15)$.

An exponential distribution is defined by its rate parameter, $\lambda$. The mean of an exponential distribution is given by $1/\lambda$.
Given that the mean is 5, we can find $\lambda$:
$Mean = 1/\lambda = 5$
$\lambda = 1/5 = 0.2$

The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** for an exponential distribution is $F(x) = P(X \leq x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}$.
To find the probability $P(10 \leq X \leq 15)$, we can use the formula $P(a \leq X \leq b) = F(b) - F(a)$.
In this case, $a = 10$ and $b = 15$.
$P(10 \leq X \leq 15) = P(X \leq 15) - P(X \leq 10)$
$P(10 \leq X \leq 15) = (1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 15}) - (1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 10})$
Substituting $\lambda = 0.2$:
$P(10 \leq X \leq 15) = (1 - e^{-0.2 \cdot 15}) - (1 - e^{-0.2 \cdot 10})$
$P(10 \leq X \leq 15) = (1 - e^{-3}) - (1 - e^{-2})$
$P(10 \leq X \leq 15) = 1 - e^{-3} - 1 + e^{-2}$
$P(10 \leq X \leq 15) = e^{-2} - e^{-3}$

This matches the option highlighted in green in the image.

---

### Part 2: Finding the value of $k$

The second image asks to find the value of $k$ such that $P(X \leq k) = 0.95$.
The problem again references the exponential distribution with a mean of 5, which means $\lambda = 0.2$.

We'll use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) again: $P(X \leq k) = 1 - e^{-\lambda k}$.
We are given that $P(X \leq k) = 0.95$.
$1 - e^{-\lambda k} = 0.95$
$1 - e^{-0.2k} = 0.95$
Now, let's solve for $k$:
$e^{-0.2k} = 1 - 0.95$
$e^{-0.2k} = 0.05$

To isolate $k$, we'll take the natural logarithm ($\ln$) of both sides.
$\ln(e^{-0.2k}) = \ln(0.05)$
$-0.2k = \ln(0.05)$
$k = \frac{\ln(0.05)}{-0.2}$

A key property of logarithms is that $\ln(1/x) = -\ln(x)$. We can rewrite 0.05 as a fraction: $0.05 = 5/100 = 1/20$.
So, $\ln(0.05) = \ln(1/20) = -\ln(20)$.
Substituting this back into the equation for $k$:
$k = \frac{-\ln(20)}{-0.2}$
$k = \frac{\ln(20)}{0.2}$

Since $0.2 = 1/5$, we can write:
$k = \frac{\ln(20)}{1/5} = 5 \ln(20)$

This result, $5(\ln 20)$, corresponds to the option highlighted in green in the third image.

Based on the images you provided, let's solve these two probability problems. The problems are based on a discrete random variable $X$ with the probability mass function (PMF) given by:

$f_X(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{x}{15}, & x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

---

## Part 1: Finding $P(X=1 \text{ or } X=2)$

The first problem asks for the value of $P(X=1 \text{ or } X=2)$, which can be written as $P(X=1) + P(X=2)$. Since $X=1$ and $X=2$ are distinct outcomes, they are mutually exclusive events.

From the PMF, we have:
* $P(X=1) = f_X(1) = \frac{1}{15}$
* $P(X=2) = f_X(2) = \frac{2}{15}$

Now, we can find the sum:
$P(X=1 \text{ or } X=2) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) = \frac{1}{15} + \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15}$

Simplifying the fraction gives us $\frac{1}{5}$. To get the answer correct to one decimal place as requested, we convert this to a decimal:
$\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$

The value of $P(X=1 \text{ or } X=2)$ is **0.2**.

---

## Part 2: Finding $P(\frac{1}{2} < X < \frac{5}{2} \mid X > 1)$

This is a conditional probability problem, which can be solved using the formula $P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$.

In this case, let's define our events:
* Event $A$: $\frac{1}{2} < X < \frac{5}{2}$
* Event $B$: $X > 1$

First, let's identify the values of $X$ that satisfy each event based on the given PMF. The possible values for $X$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Step 1: Determine the events
For event $A$, the values of $X$ must be between 0.5 and 2.5. The only integer values of $X$ from the given set that fall into this range are $X=1$ and $X=2$.
So, $P(A) = P(\frac{1}{2} < X < \frac{5}{2}) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) = \frac{1}{15} + \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15}$.

For event $B$, the values of $X$ must be greater than 1. The possible integer values of $X$ are 2, 3, 4, and 5.
So, $P(B) = P(X > 1) = P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4) + P(X=5)$.
$P(B) = \frac{2}{15} + \frac{3}{15} + \frac{4}{15} + \frac{5}{15} = \frac{2+3+4+5}{15} = \frac{14}{15}$.

### Step 2: Find the intersection of the events
The intersection of events $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cap B$, includes the values of $X$ that satisfy both conditions: $\frac{1}{2} < X < \frac{5}{2}$ **AND** $X > 1$.
The values that satisfy both are the integers greater than 1 but less than 2.5. The only value is $X=2$.
So, $P(A \cap B) = P(X=2) = \frac{2}{15}$.

### Step 3: Calculate the conditional probability
Using the conditional probability formula:
$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(X=2)}{P(X > 1)} = \frac{\frac{2}{15}}{\frac{14}{15}}$

To simplify the fraction, we can cancel out the denominators:
$P(A \mid B) = \frac{2}{14} = \frac{1}{7}$

### Step 4: Convert to a decimal
The question asks for the answer to two decimal places.
$\frac{1}{7} \approx 0.142857...$

Rounding to two decimal places, we get **0.14**.




<img width="1011" height="367" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5659032-81b1-4f68-a00a-4f12a9c28601" />
We are given a two-step random experiment:

1. Sushant throws a **fair die**.
2. Then, he flips as many **fair coins** as the number shown on the die.

We are told that the die showed **5**, and we are to find the **conditional probability** that **3 heads** are obtained in the coin tosses.

---

### Step 1: Understand the conditional setup

Given: Die shows 5 → So, **5 fair coins** are tossed.

We are to compute:

> $ P(\text{3 heads} \mid \text{die showed 5}) $

Since the die outcome is given (5), this is a straightforward binomial-type probability.

---

### Step 2: Model the coin tosses

Each of the 5 coins is fair and independent.

Let $ X $ be the number of heads in 5 fair coin tosses. Then $ X \sim \text{Binomial}(n=5, p=0.5) $

We want:

$$
P(X = 3) = \binom{5}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} = \binom{5}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5
$$

$$
= 10 \times \frac{1}{32} = \frac{10}{32} = \frac{5}{16} = 0.3125
$$

---

### Step 3: Round to three decimal places

$$
0.3125 \approx \boxed{0.313}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{0.313}
$$





<img width="994" height="156" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3274ee16-188e-4c53-a4e6-7dce79f0b500" />
We are given that $ X \sim \text{Uniform}[0, \theta] $, with unknown parameter $ \theta $, and a sample:  
$$
(4, 7, 8, 11, 5)
$$

We are to compute:
$$
|\hat{\theta}_{MME} - \hat{\theta}_{ML}|
$$
where:
- $ \hat{\theta}_{MME} $ is the **method of moments estimator**,
- $ \hat{\theta}_{ML} $ is the **maximum likelihood estimator**.

---

### Step 1: Method of Moments Estimator (MME)

For a Uniform$[0, \theta]$ distribution:

- The expected value is:
  $$
  E[X] = \frac{\theta}{2}
  $$

The method of moments equates the population mean to the sample mean.

Let $ \bar{X} $ be the sample mean:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{4 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 5}{5} = \frac{35}{5} = 7
$$

Set $ E[X] = \bar{X} $:
$$
\frac{\theta}{2} = 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \theta = 14
$$

So:
$$
\hat{\theta}_{MME} = 14
$$

---

### Step 2: Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)

For $ X_i \sim \text{Uniform}[0, \theta] $, the likelihood function is:
$$
L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\theta} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{0 \leq x_i \leq \theta\}} = \frac{1}{\theta^n} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{\max x_i \leq \theta\}}
$$

This is maximized when $ \theta $ is as small as possible but still $ \geq \max x_i $. So:
$$
\hat{\theta}_{ML} = \max(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)
$$

From the sample: $ (4, 7, 8, 11, 5) $, the maximum is:
$$
\hat{\theta}_{ML} = 11
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute the Absolute Difference

$$
|\hat{\theta}_{MME} - \hat{\theta}_{ML}| = |14 - 11| = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3}
$$

We are given that $ X \sim \text{Binomial}(6, p) $, and we are to find the value of $ p $ such that:

$$
9P(X = 4) = P(X = 2)
$$

---

### Step 1: Use the Binomial Probability Formula

The probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution is:

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}
$$

Here, $ n = 6 $. So,

$$
P(X = 4) = \binom{6}{4} p^4 (1 - p)^2
$$
$$
P(X = 2) = \binom{6}{2} p^2 (1 - p)^4
$$

Now compute the binomial coefficients:

- $ \binom{6}{4} = 15 $
- $ \binom{6}{2} = 15 $

So:

$$
P(X = 4) = 15 p^4 (1 - p)^2
$$
$$
P(X = 2) = 15 p^2 (1 - p)^4
$$

Now plug into the equation:

$$
9P(X = 4) = P(X = 2)
$$
$$
9 \cdot 15 p^4 (1 - p)^2 = 15 p^2 (1 - p)^4
$$

Divide both sides by 15:

$$
9 p^4 (1 - p)^2 = p^2 (1 - p)^4
$$

Now divide both sides by $ p^2 (1 - p)^2 $ (assuming $ p \neq 0 $ and $ p \neq 1 $):

$$
9 p^2 = (1 - p)^2
$$

Now take square roots or expand:

$$
9p^2 = (1 - p)^2 = 1 - 2p + p^2
$$

Bring all terms to one side:

$$
9p^2 - (1 - 2p + p^2) = 0
$$
$$
9p^2 - 1 + 2p - p^2 = 0
$$
$$
8p^2 + 2p - 1 = 0
$$

Now solve the quadratic equation:

$$
8p^2 + 2p - 1 = 0
$$

Use the quadratic formula:

$$
p = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(8)(-1)}}{2(8)} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 32}}{16} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{36}}{16}
$$
$$
p = \frac{-2 \pm 6}{16}
$$

So:

- $ p = \frac{-2 + 6}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} $
- $ p = \frac{-2 - 6}{16} = \frac{-8}{16} = -\frac{1}{2} $ → Not valid (since $ p \in [0,1] $)

So the only valid solution is:

$$
\boxed{p = \frac{1}{4}}
$$

---

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}
$$

✅ **Correct option: $ \frac{1}{4} $**
<img width="828" height="79" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccfa86bf-b75b-4aa2-8bb5-3134dc86025e" />
We are given that $ X \sim \text{Binomial}(6, p) $, and from the previous part, we found that $ p = \frac{1}{4} $.

We are to find $ \mathbb{E}[X^2] $, the expected value of $ X^2 $, correct to two decimal places.

---

### Step 1: Use the identity

$$
\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \text{Var}(X) + (\mathbb{E}[X])^2
$$

For a binomial distribution:

- $ \mathbb{E}[X] = np $
- $ \text{Var}(X) = np(1 - p) $

Given:
- $ n = 6 $
- $ p = \frac{1}{4} $

So:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1.5
$$

$$
\text{Var}(X) = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{4}\right) = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 6 \cdot \frac{3}{16} = \frac{18}{16} = 1.125
$$

Now compute:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \text{Var}(X) + (\mathbb{E}[X])^2 = 1.125 + (1.5)^2 = 1.125 + 2.25 = 3.375
$$

Rounded to two decimal places:

$$
\boxed{3.38}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3.38}
$$




<img width="974" height="346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcca1f62-3631-4d17-9927-6dd63871245c" />

We are given the probability density function (pdf) of a continuous random variable $ X $:

$$
f_X(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1 + \theta x}{2}, & -1 < x < 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
where $ -1 < \theta < 1 $.

We are also given a random sample:  
$$
(-0.2, 0.3, 0.7, -0.6, 0.1)
$$

We are to find the **method of moments estimate** (MME) of $ \theta $.

---

### **Step 1: Find the theoretical first moment (mean)**

The method of moments involves equating the population moments to the sample moments.

Let’s compute the **first population moment**, i.e., $ E[X] $, in terms of $ \theta $.

$$
E[X] = \int_{-1}^{1} x f_X(x) \, dx = \int_{-1}^{1} x \cdot \frac{1 + \theta x}{2} \, dx
$$

Simplify the integrand:

$$
E[X] = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} x(1 + \theta x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} (x + \theta x^2) \, dx
$$

Now integrate term by term:

$$
\int_{-1}^{1} x \, dx = 0 \quad \text{(odd function over symmetric interval)}
$$

$$
\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 \, dx = 2 \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = 2 \cdot \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

So,

$$
E[X] = \frac{1}{2} \left( 0 + \theta \cdot \frac{2}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2\theta}{3} = \frac{\theta}{3}
$$

Thus,
$$
E[X] = \frac{\theta}{3}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Compute the sample mean**

Given sample: $ (-0.2, 0.3, 0.7, -0.6, 0.1) $

Sample mean:
$$
\bar{x} = \frac{-0.2 + 0.3 + 0.7 - 0.6 + 0.1}{5} = \frac{0.3}{5} = 0.06
$$

---

### **Step 3: Equate population and sample moments**

Set:
$$
E[X] = \bar{x} \Rightarrow \frac{\theta}{3} = 0.06
$$

Solve for $ \theta $:
$$
\theta = 3 \times 0.06 = 0.18
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{0.18}
$$

This is the method of moments estimate of $ \theta $, correct to two decimal places.

<img width="1027" height="570" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f86becc-d172-4f9b-9724-15847e885be4" />
We are given the same density function:

$$
f_X(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1 + \theta x}{2}, & -1 < x < 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
where $ -1 < \theta < 1 $.

We are now given a random sample:
$$
\left( -\frac{1}{2},\ 0,\ \frac{1}{3},\ 0,\ \frac{1}{3} \right)
$$

We are to find the **maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)** of $ \theta $, correct to two decimal places.

---

### **Step 1: Write the likelihood function**

Let $ X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5 $ be the sample values.

The likelihood function is:
$$
L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^5 f_X(x_i) = \prod_{i=1}^5 \frac{1 + \theta x_i}{2}
$$

So,
$$
L(\theta) = \frac{1}{2^5} \prod_{i=1}^5 (1 + \theta x_i)
$$

Now plug in the sample values:
- $ x_1 = -\frac{1}{2} $
- $ x_2 = 0 $
- $ x_3 = \frac{1}{3} $
- $ x_4 = 0 $
- $ x_5 = \frac{1}{3} $

Then:
$$
L(\theta) = \frac{1}{32} \cdot (1 + \theta(-1/2)) \cdot (1 + \theta \cdot 0) \cdot (1 + \theta \cdot 1/3) \cdot (1 + \theta \cdot 0) \cdot (1 + \theta \cdot 1/3)
$$

Simplify:
$$
L(\theta) = \frac{1}{32} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cdot (1) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{\theta}{3}\right) \cdot (1) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{\theta}{3}\right)
$$

So,
$$
L(\theta) = \frac{1}{32} \left(1 - \frac{\theta}{2}\right) \left(1 + \frac{\theta}{3}\right)^2
$$

---

### **Step 2: Take logarithm (log-likelihood)**

Let:
$$
\ell(\theta) = \log L(\theta) = -\log 32 + \log\left(1 - \frac{\theta}{2}\right) + 2 \log\left(1 + \frac{\theta}{3}\right)
$$

Now differentiate with respect to $ \theta $:

$$
\ell'(\theta) = \frac{d}{d\theta} \left[ \log\left(1 - \frac{\theta}{2}\right) + 2 \log\left(1 + \frac{\theta}{3}\right) \right]
$$

$$
= \frac{-1/2}{1 - \theta/2} + 2 \cdot \frac{1/3}{1 + \theta/3}
= \frac{-1}{2(1 - \theta/2)} + \frac{2}{3(1 + \theta/3)}
$$

Set derivative equal to zero for MLE:

$$
\frac{-1}{2(1 - \theta/2)} + \frac{2}{3(1 + \theta/3)} = 0
$$

Move one term to the other side:

$$
\frac{2}{3(1 + \theta/3)} = \frac{1}{2(1 - \theta/2)}
$$

Now solve this equation.

---

### **Step 3: Solve the equation**

First, simplify both sides.

Left-hand side:
$$
\frac{2}{3(1 + \theta/3)} = \frac{2}{3 + \theta}
$$

Right-hand side:
$$
\frac{1}{2(1 - \theta/2)} = \frac{1}{2 - \theta}
$$

So:
$$
\frac{2}{3 + \theta} = \frac{1}{2 - \theta}
$$

Cross-multiply:
$$
2(2 - \theta) = 1(3 + \theta)
\Rightarrow 4 - 2\theta = 3 + \theta
\Rightarrow 4 - 3 = 2\theta + \theta
\Rightarrow 1 = 3\theta
\Rightarrow \theta = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333...
$$

---

### **Step 4: Check if this is valid and maximizes likelihood**

We must check that $ \theta = \frac{1}{3} \in (-1, 1) $: yes.

Also, verify that all $ x_i \in (-1,1) $: yes.

Now check second derivative or behavior to confirm it's a maximum.

But since the log-likelihood increases then decreases around this point (as we'll see), and we have only one critical point, and the likelihood goes to 0 as $ \theta \to \pm1 $, this is likely the maximum.

Let’s verify by plugging in nearby values.

But first, note that the accepted answer range is **0.30 to 0.36**, so $ \theta = 0.33 $ fits perfectly.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{0.33}
$$

(correct to two decimal places)



<img width="1036" height="229" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f86f1b5b-f258-42d8-a125-068816302e57" />

We are given the **moment generating function (MGF)** of a discrete random variable $ X $:

$$
M_X(\lambda) = \frac{1}{8}e^{-4\lambda} + \frac{1}{6}e^{-2\lambda} + \frac{1}{6}e^{2\lambda} + \frac{1}{8}e^{4\lambda} + \frac{5}{12}
$$

We are to find the **probability mass function (PMF)** of $ X $, i.e., the values of $ x $ and their corresponding probabilities $ f_X(x) $.

---

### Step 1: Recall the definition of MGF

For a discrete random variable $ X $, the moment generating function is:

$$
M_X(\lambda) = \mathbb{E}[e^{\lambda X}] = \sum_{x} e^{\lambda x} P(X = x)
$$

So, each term in the MGF corresponds to a value of $ x $ such that $ e^{\lambda x} $ appears with coefficient $ P(X = x) $.

---

### Step 2: Identify the terms

Let’s look at each term in $ M_X(\lambda) $:

1. $ \frac{1}{8}e^{-4\lambda} $ → corresponds to $ x = -4 $, with probability $ \frac{1}{8} $
2. $ \frac{1}{6}e^{-2\lambda} $ → corresponds to $ x = -2 $, with probability $ \frac{1}{6} $
3. $ \frac{1}{6}e^{2\lambda} $ → corresponds to $ x = 2 $, with probability $ \frac{1}{6} $
4. $ \frac{1}{8}e^{4\lambda} $ → corresponds to $ x = 4 $, with probability $ \frac{1}{8} $
5. $ \frac{5}{12} $ → this is $ \frac{5}{12}e^{0\cdot\lambda} $, so it corresponds to $ x = 0 $, with probability $ \frac{5}{12} $

---

### Step 3: List the PMF

So the possible values of $ X $ are:

- $ x = -4 $, $ P(X = -4) = \frac{1}{8} $
- $ x = -2 $, $ P(X = -2) = \frac{1}{6} $
- $ x = 0 $, $ P(X = 0) = \frac{5}{12} $
- $ x = 2 $, $ P(X = 2) = \frac{1}{6} $
- $ x = 4 $, $ P(X = 4) = \frac{1}{8} $

Now let's check if the total probability sums to 1:

$$
\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{5}{12} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{8}
$$

Convert all to twelfths:

- $ \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{24} = \frac{1.5}{12} $? Wait — better use common denominator.

LCM of 8, 6, 12 is 24.

- $ \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{24} $
- $ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{24} $
- $ \frac{5}{12} = \frac{10}{24} $
- $ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{24} $
- $ \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{24} $

Sum: $ 3 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 3 = 24 $ → $ \frac{24}{24} = 1 $. ✅

So the probabilities are valid.

---

### Step 4: Match with options

Look at the choices:

#### Option 1:
| x   | -4 | -2 | 0  | 2  | 4  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|
| f(x)| 1/8| 1/6| 5/12| 1/6| 1/8|

✅ This matches exactly what we found.

#### Option 2:
| x   | -4 | -2 | 1  | 2  | 4  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|
| f(x)| 1/8| 1/6| 5/12| 1/6| 1/8|

❌ Has $ x=1 $ instead of $ x=0 $ → incorrect.

#### Option 3:
| x   | -4 | -2 | 0  | 2  | 4  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|
| f(x)| 1/8| 1/6| 5/12| 1/8| 1/6|

❌ Probability for $ x=2 $ is $ 1/8 $, but should be $ 1/6 $; $ x=4 $ is $ 1/6 $, but should be $ 1/8 $ → swapped → incorrect.

#### Option 4:
| x   | -4 | -2 | 1  | 2  | 4  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|
| f(x)| 1/8| 1/6| 5/12| 1/8| 1/6|

❌ Again, $ x=1 $ instead of $ x=0 $, and wrong probabilities → incorrect.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Option 1** is correct.

$$
\boxed{
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
x & -4 & -2 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
\hline
f_X(x) & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{5}{12} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{8} \\
\end{array}
}
$$

We are given the **probability mass function (PMF)** of a discrete random variable $ X $:

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
x & -4 & -2 & 0 & 2 & 4 \\
\hline
f_X(x) & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{5}{12} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{8} \\
\end{array}
$$

We are to compute the **variance** of $ X $, denoted $ \text{Var}(X) $, and report it correct to **two decimal places**.

### Step 1: Recall the formula for variance

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2
$$

So we need to compute:
1. $ \mathbb{E}[X] $
2. $ \mathbb{E}[X^2] $

---

### Step 2: Compute $ \mathbb{E}[X] $

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum x \cdot P(X = x)
$$

$$
= (-4)\cdot\frac{1}{8} + (-2)\cdot\frac{1}{6} + (0)\cdot\frac{5}{12} + (2)\cdot\frac{1}{6} + (4)\cdot\frac{1}{8}
$$

Compute each term:

- $ -4 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = -0.5 $
- $ -2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \approx -0.3333 $
- $ 0 \cdot \frac{5}{12} = 0 $
- $ 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.3333 $
- $ 4 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 0.5 $

Now sum:

$$
-0.5 - 0.3333 + 0 + 0.3333 + 0.5 = 0
$$

✅ So $ \mathbb{E}[X] = 0 $

This makes sense — the distribution is symmetric about 0.

---

### Step 3: Compute $ \mathbb{E}[X^2] $

$$
\mathbb{E}[X^2] = \sum x^2 \cdot P(X = x)
$$

Compute each $ x^2 $:

- $ (-4)^2 = 16 $, prob $ \frac{1}{8} $ → $ 16 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 2 $
- $ (-2)^2 = 4 $, prob $ \frac{1}{6} $ → $ 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.6667 $
- $ 0^2 = 0 $, prob $ \frac{5}{12} $ → $ 0 $
- $ 2^2 = 4 $, prob $ \frac{1}{6} $ → $ 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.6667 $
- $ 4^2 = 16 $, prob $ \frac{1}{8} $ → $ 16 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 2 $

Now sum:

$$
2 + 0.6667 + 0 + 0.6667 + 2 = 5.3334
$$

More precisely:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X^2] = 2 + \frac{4}{6} + \frac{4}{6} + 2 = 4 + \frac{8}{6} = 4 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{12}{3} + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.3333\ldots
$$

---

### Step 4: Compute Variance

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2 = \frac{16}{3} - 0^2 = \frac{16}{3}
$$

Now compute decimal:

$$
\frac{16}{3} \approx 5.3333\ldots
$$

Rounded to two decimal places:

$$
\boxed{5.33}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{5.33}
$$
